        <h1>Replenishment Overview</h1>
        <p>Replenishment is the process of ordering stock over time in order to meet anticipated demand. </p>
        <p>In JustEnough, the replenishment process is driven automatically according to the following inputs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The forecasted daily demand for each of your items at each of your locations.</li>
            <li>The projected daily stock on hand at your store locations and distribution centers.</li>
            <li>The replenishment-related ordering parameters defined for your items.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JustEnough uses this information to automatically create the best possible replenishment strategy for your organization, resulting in an optimized series of orders available in the Order Manager. These orders ensure that stock arrives at your distribution centers and individual store locations just in time to meet anticipated demand, with the minimum required overhead.</p>
        <p>The JustEnough replenishment process is illustrated below:</p>

        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">In this process, JustEnough's stastical forecasts predict the unconstrained daily demand for each of your items at each of your locations. Before orders can be placed however, the ordering rules set up for each item must be considered. Factors such as minimum and maximum order quantities, lead times, supply chains, etc. all influence how orders are optimized by JustEnough. (See <MadCap:xref href="Replenishment Parameters.htm">Replenishment Parameters</MadCap:xref> for more information about each of these factors.) Once JustEnough creates an optimal replenishment plan for your items based on the demand forecast and replenishment parameters, it creates the orders in the Order Manager.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Although the replenishment process is automated and happens largely behind-the-scenes, you can monitor ongoing replenishment status for your items through the Item Manager.</p>
