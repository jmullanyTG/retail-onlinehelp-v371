        <h1 >Edit Hierarchy</h1>
        <p>The hierarchy maintenance window allows users an opportunity to edit the forecasting levels, as well as establish the accuracy grading criteria for the accuracy dashboard. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Levels may be selected one at a time, or several at once using the multi-select. Accuracy tolerances should be set for each level.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Level order may be adjusted as well, however, it is important that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if users intend to include the “all aggregated together” level, it must be the highest level order</span>. If not, JustEnough will return and error stating an invalid hierarchy. </p>
