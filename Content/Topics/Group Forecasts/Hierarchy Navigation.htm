        <h1 >Hierarchy Navigation</h1>
        <p>The hierarchy navigation section functions as both a description of the included data and levels for the model, but also as the main navigation pane for the other group forecasting data screens. Highlighted levels will display their data in the “current hierarchy level – data” and “current hierarchy level – details” views. </p>
