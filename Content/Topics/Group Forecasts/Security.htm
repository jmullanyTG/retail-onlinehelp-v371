        <h1 >Security</h1>
        <p>When building group forecast models, it is possible to circumvent the item assign filter restrictions. This is intentional, as access to these item/location combinations may be necessary in order to properly build an accurate model. As such, assigning proper security rights to the model is an important step.</p>
        <p>The item assign filter rules will be applied to the user who is creating the model (e.g. you can’t create a model out of someone else’s item assign filter), however, if the model is shared, users may be able to view items outside of their item assign filter. Users working in the model will “impersonate” the rights of the user who has created the model. </p>
        <p>In instances where interdepartmental security is important, users creating the model should specifically exclude users or roles which should not have view permission by changing the security setting to “private” or “shared”.</p>
