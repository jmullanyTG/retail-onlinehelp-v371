        <h1 class="Heading1">Forecast Group Model Management</h1>
        <p>Group forecasts are generated by first building a model, which is then processed by the JustEnough forecasting engine to provide a statistical forecast or projected demand at a hierarchal level. Much care should go into building these models, as illogical choices may inappropriately skew the results and affect many interdependent items and/or locations. </p>
