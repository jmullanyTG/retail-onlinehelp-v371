        <p>The group forecast model view will allow users to interact with the group forecast data. The data series for included columns as well as forecast accuracy may be viewed for each level within the hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Common actions for users at the model level include a re-forecast of the model, a filter link, and the execution of a data push. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forecast Model – </span>This action will bring up the forecast method selection window, allowing users to view and select the available forecast methods. Selecting “Ok” will reforecast the entire model. Depending on the size and complexity of the model, this may take a considerable amount of time. For large models, the slice forecast functionality would be a preferred method for reforecasting. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Link –</span> The link button will allow users to isolate inventories within the model by using a filter. The linked items will be the overlap section of a Venn diagram between the model and the selected filter. This view is the inverse of the “inventory apply rules” view. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manual Push –</span> Executing a manual push will write the group level forecast data to the live forecast tables. The values will be written along with an accompanying forecast type. </li>
        </ul>
