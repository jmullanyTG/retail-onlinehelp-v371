        <h1 >Advanced Settings</h1>
        <p>The advanced settings section will allow users an opportunity to choose the columns which are returned in the group forecast report. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">View Type – </span>Will adjust the viewing period for the forecast series. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rolling Start Period –</span> Will bring the start period of the series to align with the current date (similar view to the standard Forecasts Module). As time “rolls by”, the forecasted view will roll forward with it.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offset Start Days –</span> Offset start days will allow the users to specify the period ahead at which they would always like to view the forecast series. This is a useful setting for planners as they may set the offset days to several months ahead to align with their planning schedule. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Month Defined –</span> Locks in the start month for the series. If selected, users will be prompted to select the start month. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Default Volume Metric –</span> The volume metric setting will calculate the appropriate volume or mass (described as weight) based on units and the supplied volumetric data (data feed). This is a performance heavy option as it requires calculations at every level of the hierarchy. Will display in the “VolumeMetricValue” column. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The column settings section should be recognizable to users familiar with the pivot grid widget layout configuration in the Views Module, with the ability to edit column friendly names (the name which appears in the view), data type and format string, summary types and order. Visible flag will decide if the column is returned or not (unchecking CostPrice, SellingPrice, and VolumeMetricValue will drastically improve performance). </p>
