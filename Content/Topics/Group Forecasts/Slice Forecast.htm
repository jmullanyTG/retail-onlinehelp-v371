        <h1 class="Heading1">Slice Forecast</h1>
        <p>Within the Group Forecasting module, users can now forecast a selected “slice” of the model. Slices are a vertical hierarchy built as a part of the model and are anchored around each item at the top of a static hierarchy. </p>
        <p>Slices may be forecast individually in order to improve the overall performance of the Group Forecasting module.</p>
