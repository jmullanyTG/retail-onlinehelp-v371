        <h1>Technical Notes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>When a new filter is created, its cache is built immediately. </li>
            <li>Rebuilding filter caches is an extremely important task and should, in most instances, be run on a daily basis. This may take a considerable amount of time during the overnight run and will depend on the volume of data and the number of filters which need to be rebuilt. </li>
            <li>Custom code should no longer reference<code> tbl_FilterCache</code>, because population of<code> tbl_FilterCahce</code> is optional when filters are rebuilt. </li>
            <li><code>Udf_ApplyFilter</code> has been officially scheduled for deprecation and should not be called.</li>
        </ul>
