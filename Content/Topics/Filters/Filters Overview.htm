        <h1>Filters Overview</h1>
        <p>Filters are an essential tool for working in JustEnough, as they let you see only the subsets of data that you want to work with in a given screen (or that you want JustEnough to work with in a given process). You can make filters as simple or as complex as you need, and then save them for future use. Once created, you can share filters with your entire organization, with select others, or keep them for your own private use.&#160;&#160; </p>
        <h2>Flexible designs</h2>
        <p>Filters are extremely flexible and are able to support:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Static data</b>: once the filter is created, the data it returns never changes. This assures users that they will see the same data whenever they use the filter.</li>
            <li><b>Static conditions</b>: the conditions used to filter data cannot change, but the data returned can change. This assures users that the data they see when using the filter is current.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Dynamic conditions</b>: users can choose the condition values used to filter data. This assures users that the data they see when using this filter is relevant to their current need.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Entity-specific filtering</h2>
        <p>Because different areas of JustEnough involve different data “entities” (suppliers, inventory, sites, etc.), JustEnough automatically shows users only the filters that apply to the relevant entity. For example, in the Suppliers screen, users will see a list of available supplier filters as opposed to a mix of supplier, inventory, and site filters. </p>
