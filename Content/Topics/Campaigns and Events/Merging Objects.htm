        <h1>Merging Objects</h1>
        <p>Merging combines two adjacent objects into a single object. It is available to the following object types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Price Display Formats.htm">Price display format</a> containers</li>
            <li><a href="Attribute Display Formats.htm">Attribute display format</a> containers</li>
            <li><a href="Item Display Formats.htm">Item display format</a> containers</li>
            <li><a href="Slot Set Templates.htm">Slot set templates</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="Editing Slot Set Layouts.htm">Event slot sets</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Merge options</h2>
        <p>The Merge toolbar menu contains the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Merge Up</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Merge Down</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Merge Left</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Merge Right</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Notes</b>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">
                <p>Merge options are only available when there is at least one another object adjacent (above/below or to the right/left) to the selected object.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can choose a merge option from the <b>Merge</b> menu on the toolbar or by right-clicking an object and choosing the option from the context menu.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Merge right-click.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Only the merge options that apply to a selected object will be enabled. For example, in the screenshot above, only the <b>Merge Right</b> option is available because the only other adjacent container is located to the right of the selected container.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">You can merge one object with multiple other objects if the other objects combine to share the same border width or height as the original object. (See example below.)</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b style="color: #ff0000;">WARNING</b>:&#160;When merging, only the content in the originally-selected object is preserved (see examples below).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>The following examples are shown using price display formats, but apply to the other supported objects as well.</p>
        <h3>Merging equally-sized objects</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select an object with at least one other object adjacent to it. The selected object is outlined in blue.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Merge Example 1.png" />
                </p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Note</b>: A purple line along the selected object's border indicates that merging in that direction is possible.<br /></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select an available merge option.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Merge Example 2.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The objects merge. Note that the merge removed the content that was in the adjacent object, and only the selected object's contents and properties are preserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/merge Example 3.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Merging multiple adjacent objects</h3>
        <p>In this example, we will merge a container with two other containers that, combined, share the same height  as the selected container.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Select an object that has multiple objects along its entire top, bottom, or side. In this example, the selected object is adjacent to two horizontally-stacked containers that combine to be the same height as the selected container. </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p><b>Note</b>: The purple line along the selected object's right border indicates that merging in that direction is possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select an available merge option.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The objects merge. Note that the merge removed the content that was in the adjacent objects, and only the selected object's contents and properties are preserved.</p>
