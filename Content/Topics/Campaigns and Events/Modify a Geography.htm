        <h1 >Modify a Geography</h1>
        <p>Usually, modifying a Geography involves adding or removing Sites from it. (For more information, see <a href="Add Sites to a Geography.htm">Add Sites to a Geography</a> and <a href="Remove Sites from a Geography.htm">Remove Sites from a Geography</a>.)</p>
        <p> The user can also change the Name, Start Date, or End Date by making changes directly in the Geographies grid. Altering the dates would adjust the distribution of the Event to the Geography’s associated Sites to the new dates specified. A Geography’s Start and End Dates must fall within the Event’s Ad Dates.</p>
