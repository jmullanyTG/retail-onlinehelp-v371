        <h1 >Modify a Promotion</h1>
        <p>Once a Promotion has been added to a Slot, it can be modified from either the List or Layout views. To modify a Promotion in an Event, select the Promotion in the Slot Set and click on Promotion <span style="font-weight: bold;">View</span>. This will open the Promotion Details screen in Promotion Manager. Modify the Promotion as needed and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>. Navigate back to the Events solution and refresh the Slot Set to see the updates.</p>
        <p>Depending on the Global Policy ‘Promotion Double Click Action’ setting, double clicking on an assigned Promotion in the Slot Set will load the Promotion in either a window or in the Promotions solution. Modifications can also be made using this method.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to modify the Event Content for a Promotion. For more information, see <a href="Content Editor.htm">Content Editor</a>.</p>
