        <h1 >Workflow Status Changes</h1>
        <p>Depending on the Workflow chosen for the Event, each Event may transition through one or more Statuses. The Event Schedule consists of actual dates for each Status based on the configured Workflow and the Event Ad Start Date. </p>
        <p>All Slot Sets inherit the Event Status. At the onset of a new Status, the Slot Sets are also assigned a Status State of ‘In Progress’ which indicates that Slot Sets are currently being worked before the current Status is marked as ‘complete’.</p>
