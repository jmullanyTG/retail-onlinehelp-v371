        <p>Event Manager supports the management of Promotions for the marketing and advertising teams. It allows you to group Promotions into Events and Campaigns for tracking analytical goals, target Campaigns and Events to specific demographic or geographic areas and visually build Promotions across media types. </p>
        <p>The Calendar view displays all Campaigns and Events together in a Gantt chart format allowing you to navigate to a specific Campaign or date and view all related Events. Color-coding is used to visually differentiate the various Campaigns and Event Types. Campaign color is selected during Campaign creation while Event Type dictates Event color.</p>
        <p>New Events are easily created using the new Event wizard, which walks the user through defining the Event name, associated Campaign, Event Type, Budget, and Ad and Sales Start and End Dates. Typically, each Event represents a separate channel with unique effective dates, production schedule and Budgets.</p>
        <p>Marketing Budgets can be created for each Event and each production category required for the Event to be executed. Actual spend for each category is also available to support automatic rollup-ups by Cost Type.</p>
        <p>After an Event is created using a defined Event Type, the planner can start to customize the Event. You can add and modify Slot Sets, create and delete Geographies, modify Site assignments and build out a detailed Budget. You can then decide which vendor deals or Promotions to include in the Event. A visual representation of each Promotion provides instant feedback by displaying the Content, Pricing and any associated digital assets.</p>
        <p>The default targeting for each Event is predefined based on Event Type. For print Events, the segments might be geographic; while for electronic Events, the segments might be demographic. The segments can also be mixed to allow for demographic segmentation within a geographic area. The targeting can be changed at any time allowing planners to quickly react to changing market conditions.</p>
        <p>You can quickly create a new Promotion for one or more products and apply pricing and date ranges in a few easy steps using the New Promotion wizard.</p>
        <p>You can group stores/Sites together within a Promotion so they can be targeted with common Promotional Strategies. Multiple Promotion Strategies can be set by Price Cluster within a single Promotion to allow for easy management and monitoring. In addition, the products promoted for each Price Cluster in a Promotion can be varied to account for regional availability and targeting.</p>
