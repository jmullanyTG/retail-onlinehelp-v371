        <h1 class="Heading1">Event Compositions</h1>
        <p>The Event’s default Slot Sets are arranged in a specified order that is known as a Composition. The Event Type can be configured to version the Event, to contain more than one Composition, for one or more Geographies. It is also possible to have the total number of Slot Sets vary by Event Composition. Compositions allow you to build alternate Slot Sets for specific Geographies using completely different layouts and product selections. The Event Compositions screen provides the ability to perform these actions.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a print ad where one Composition for the Eastern and Central US distribution points receives a 4-page ad while a second Composition for the Mountain and Western US distribution points receives a 2-page ad. In addition, a third Composition is used to differentiate the Grand Opening ad for a subset of Geographies separated from the original Eastern and Central Geographies.</p>
