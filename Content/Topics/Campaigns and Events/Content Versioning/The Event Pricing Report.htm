        <h1>The Event Pricing Report</h1>
        <p>Located in the Reports tab of the Event Workbench, the Event Pricing report will show if a Promotion within a Slot has multiple values for a Geography, whether they are caused by a gap because of a missing store, or multiple prices because of links to multiple Price Clusters. In the case of a gap the report will list stores that are in the Geography but not in the Promotion. Once these issues are resolved the Geography should only show once for the Promotion with a report status of ‘Ok’. </p>
        <p>The Event Pricing report in this example shows a Promotion is Slot 5 of Slot Set '01' with a false version created by 'Store 0612' missing from the Promotion assigned to that Slot. The conflict can be resolved either by adding the Site to the Promotion or by removing it from the Geography ‘Market 02’.</p>
