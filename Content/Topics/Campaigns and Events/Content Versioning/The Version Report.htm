        <h1>The Version Report</h1>
        <p>Located in the Reports tab of the Event Workbench, the Version report can be run to show either high-level previews of Base Versions, or a detailed view of the content and pricing data for the Promotions within an Event, and can be used to view differences in content between ‘Base A’ and other calculated bases. The report provides a comprehensive view of the Promotion data for each Slot, although due to the large amount of data returned by the report, it may take time to review all of the data provided.</p>
