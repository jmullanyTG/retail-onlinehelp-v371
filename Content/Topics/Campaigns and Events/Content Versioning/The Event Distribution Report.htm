        <h1>The Event Distribution Report </h1>
        <p>Located in the Reports tab of the Event Workbench, the Event Distribution report shows how the versioned Slot Sets for the complete Event match up by Geography in the form of distribution sets. Ideally each reported distribution set will be composed of a list of Slot Sets, each with a single version, or the designation of “NA” indicating that the Slot Set either has no Promotions assigned, or has been identified as an “Unadvertised” Slot Set that does not get versioned.</p>
        <p>The example Event Distribution report below shows that the Slot Set 'Inside Left' is producing multiple versions indicating there is a possible issue with mismatched Geographies and Price Cluster for at least one Promotion.</p>
