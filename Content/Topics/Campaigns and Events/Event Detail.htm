        <p>The Event Detail screen is displayed immediately after creation or if an existing Event is opened from the List or Calendar view for review or modification. Depending on the user’s permissions configured for the Event’s current Workflow Status, this screen provides the ability to review or modify the Event Header information, Slot Sets, Geographies, Budget and Composition.</p>

        <p>The screen consists primarily of two areas, the Event Navigation Pane and the workspace area. Making a selection in the Event Navigation Pane will refresh the workspace area.</p>
        <p>The Event Navigation Pane consists of a display of the Event and its Slot Sets in a tree style navigation. <span style="color: #000000;">Selecting the Event in the tree, will refresh the workspace area to display Geography, Budget and Workbench tabs along with several </span><span style="color: #000000;">button</span><span style="color: #000000;">s.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Selecting a Slot Set, will load the Slot Set Pane below the tree and refresh the workspace to provide access to List, Layout, Versions, View, Content, as well as additional </span><span style="color: #000000;">button</span><span style="color: #000000;">s that are not available with Event selection. Event planning activities mostly occur at the Slot Set level.</span></p>
