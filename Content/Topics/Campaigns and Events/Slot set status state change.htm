        <h1 >Slot set status state change</h1>
        <p>To mark a Slot Set’s Status as complete, first select the Slot Set that you wish to update from the Event Navigation Pane then choose the ‘Complete’ option from the Slot Set Status dropdown list and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>By changing the Status State to ‘Complete’, it signifies that the current Event Workflow Status is completed for the selected Slot Set. When all Slot Sets in an Event have a Status State of ‘Complete’ this will trigger an Event Workflow Status change. </p>
        <p>A Slot Set may automatically advance to the next Event Status, even if the Status State has not been marked as ‘Complete’, if the Event Workflow is configured to auto advance based on an expected completion date.</p>
        <p>The Event Schedule will be updated to reflect the new Status State change for the Slot Set.</p>
