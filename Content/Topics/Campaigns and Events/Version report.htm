        <p>The report toolbar can be utilized to print, alter page setup, zoom in, out or to page, find details, and export the report in multiple formats.</p>
        <p>The versioning order is based on the order of the Geography Set used for the event.&#160; The first Geography in the set provides a constant for determining the Base Version for the Slot Set.&#160; Further versions are grouped by their highest ranked Geography.</p>
        <p>Versioning is a two-step process in which the Slot Set is first broken down into color / content versions (Bases), after which each Base Version is further broken down into additional black plate / price versions.&#160; The result is a distinct set of content data by slot set and slot needed to create a complete Composition that is applicable to one or more Geographies.</p>
        <p>Base Versions are named using alpha characters beginning with the letter ‘A’.&#160; Should the number of bases exceed 26, the base name will become a 2-character string starting with ‘AA’ and continuing as ‘AB’, ‘AC’, etc.&#160; Plate / Price versions are named numerically (Preceded with the letter ‘P’) within their computed Base Version, and resets back to ‘1’ for each base afterwards.</p>
