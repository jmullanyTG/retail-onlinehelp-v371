        <h1>Create a Geography</h1>
        <p>When a new Geography is created, it is possible to copy Event Promotions and Content from an existing Geography to the new one. To create a new Geography, click on Geography <span style="font-weight: bold;">New</span>. If desired, select an existing Geography to copy Promotions and Content from, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span>, then click Event <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>. The dates of the Geography will default to the Event Ad dates but may be modified. Add or remove Sites to the Geography as needed. </p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Add Sites to a Geography.htm">Add Sites to a Geography</a> and <a href="Remove Sites from a Geography.htm">Remove Sites from a Geography</a>.</p>
