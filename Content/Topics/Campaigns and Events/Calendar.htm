        <p>The Calendar View displays a Gantt chart view of all Campaigns and Events. Campaign colors are selected when a Campaign is created, whereas the Event Type dictates Event colors. By double clicking a Campaign, a window will open with the Campaign Header for review or edit. Double clicking an Event, within the Calendar, will open a window with the Event Header for review or edit.</p>
        <p>The Date Display Type drop down list provides the ability to view Events by their Ad Dates or their Sale Dates. The Time Scale ‘+’ and ‘–‘ buttons can be used to see Campaigns and Events displayed by time of day, day, week, month, quarter or year. </p>
