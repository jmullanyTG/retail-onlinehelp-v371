        <h1 >Version prompt</h1>
        <p>The user can toggle <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version Prompt</span>. When activated, the user is prompted to select which Geography to associate with the Promotion, every time the user clicks <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add to Event</span>. By selecting only a subset of Geographies for a Promotion, the excluded Geographies remain available to associate with a different Promotion and the Slot is not considered fully assigned. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Version Prompt</span> may be disabled at any time.</p>
