        <h1 >Delete a Geography</h1>
        <p>Deleting a Geography implies that the Sites associated with the Geography are also removed from the Event unless they have been associated with another Geography in the Event. To delete a Geography, select the checkbox beside it and click on Geography <span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete</span>. Then click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes</span> to confirm the deletion and select Event <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>. Associated Promotions will remain in the Event if they are associated with other Event Geographies, otherwise they will be available to add to a Slot Set.</p>
