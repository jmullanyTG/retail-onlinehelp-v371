        <p>The Pricing Report displays the price status for every Promotion in the Event for each Geography. This report will show if a Promotion within a Slot has multiple prices for a Geography, whether they are caused by a gap because of a missing Site in the Promotion, or multiple prices within a Geography as the Site is associated with Price Clusters that are not aligned with the Geography. Once these issues are resolved the Geography should only show once for the Promotion with a report status of ‘Ok’. Using this report, price conflicts and other issues can be identified easily and rectified at the appropriate Workflow Status.</p>
