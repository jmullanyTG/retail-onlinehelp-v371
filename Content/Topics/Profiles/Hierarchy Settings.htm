        <h1 >Hierarchy Settings</h1>
        <p>Profiles are created at a location level and a product level. This makes it possible for users to apply a profile to the projected demand for dozens or hundreds of inventories in a single step. This can be incredibly useful when introducing a new product category or creating profiles for new locations. </p>
        <p>The hierarchy has to have at least one product level and one location level; this gives the user granularity options. </p>
