        <h1 class="Heading1">Profiles Overview</h1>
        <p>The JustEnough profiles module may be used to simulate effective sales history for new items. This should be done where sales history or a supersession are not used. The profiles module will allow users to create curves based on sets of familiar items with well established product lifecycles. These curves may then be applied to new items. </p>
        <p>Within the profiles module, there are two main workflow screens: the profile management screen and the curve management screen. The curve management screen is identical to the full Curves Module and any information related to that screen should be referenced there. </p>
