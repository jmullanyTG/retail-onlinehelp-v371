        <p>The principle behind setting priorities on items is the Pareto Principle or "the 80:20 rule" which says, "A minority of input produces the majority of results." Although the exact split may not be 80/20 (it is sometimes 60:40 or 90:10) this is certainly true in inventory systems, where a few items account for the bulk of investment and return on investment. Maintaining inventory takes personnel time and costs money. When there are limits on these resources, the logical move is to try and use the available resources to control and focus on the most important items in inventory. This is accomplished by giving items priorities from A, the most important, to F, the least.</p>
