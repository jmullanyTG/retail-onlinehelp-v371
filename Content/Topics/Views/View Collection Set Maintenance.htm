        <p>By clicking “edit” on a view collection set, users will be given the option to edit the preferences of a specific view collection set. The most common tasks are the addition or subtraction of specific view collections and the reordering of the selected view collections. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the desired view collections have been included (view collections must be created first) and properly ordered, users may click “Ok” to finalize the preferences within the view collection set. It is recommended to click the “preview” button on the maintain view collection set window to confirm the layout is as desired. </p>
