        <h1 >User Access Rights</h1>
        <p>User rights are listed by both role and by individual user. Any assignment of roles to specific user accounts must be done within the JustEnough user maintenance screen by a system administrator. Once roles have been defined, they may be assigned access to specific views within the view collection. The access rights displayed will represent the highlighted view in the above window.</p>
