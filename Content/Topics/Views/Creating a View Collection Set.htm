        <h1 >Creating a View Collection Set</h1>
        <p>Creation of a view collection set is similar in many ways to the creation mechanism for groups. View collection sets must be created within a group or any sub-group. This may be done by clicking the “new” button in the view collection set heading in the window ribbon, or by right clicking on the desired location for the new view collection set. Creating a view collection set will bring up the new view collection set window. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Users will be required to enter a unique name for the view collection set and an optional description. The parented group will be listed in the group information (it may be changed in the creation/maintenance window in addition to the drag-and-drop method). Users may choose to click “Ok” at this point in order to simply create the view collection set, or they may add view collections from the available list (as detailed in view collection set maintenance).</p>
