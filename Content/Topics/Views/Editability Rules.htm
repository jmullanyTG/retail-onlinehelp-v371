        <h1 >Editability Rules</h1>
        <p>The editability rules will make a field editable by the end users when certain conditions are met. This may be used to restrict user input in cases where it may not be appropriate. To manage editability rules, users should pick a column, and a column by which to compare it. Define the comparison type and value, then determine if the field should or should not be editable. </p>
