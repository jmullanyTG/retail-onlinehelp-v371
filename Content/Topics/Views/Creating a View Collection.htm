        <h1 >Creating a View Collection </h1>
        <p>Creation of a view collection is similar in many ways to the creation mechanism for groups and view collection sets. View collection must be created within a view collection set. This may be done by clicking the “new” button in the view collection heading in the window ribbon, or by right clicking on the desired location for the new view collection. Creating a view collection will bring up the new view collection window. The process differs from the creation of a view collection set in that with a view collection, users will be given an opportunity to assign an icon for ease of navigation and the assignment of user rights.</p>
