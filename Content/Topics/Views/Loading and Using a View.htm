        <p>To see the listing of the available views, users should click in the views module and then select “views” in the lower left side of the navigation pane.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Views/Loading and Using a View.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 199px;height: 779px;" />
        </p>
        <p>From here, double clicking on a view will open it up. Several views may be opened at one time and will open in individual tabs. The view has full functionality within this module.</p>
