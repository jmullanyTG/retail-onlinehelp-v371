        <h1 >Cell Formatting/Coloring Rules </h1>
        <p>The cell formatting and coloring rules will affect how an individual cell is formatted. These settings will override any column level formatting such as the fore and back colors. When setting the rules, the order of application is important. Rules will be applied from the top of the grid to the bottom, with subsequent rules “painting over” preceding rules.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the example, the red rule will overpaint the yellow.</p>
