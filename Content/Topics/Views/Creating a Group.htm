        <h1 >Creating a Group</h1>
        <p>Groups (folders) may be created at the top level (far left, no indent) or parented by any existing group. This may be done by clicking the “new” button in the groups heading in the window ribbon, or by right clicking on the desired location for the new group. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Views/Creating a Group.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 516px;height: 159px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Creating a group will bring up the group creation window. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Views/Creating a Group_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 413px;height: 217px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Users will be asked to enter a unique name on that level for the group and an optional description. Once a group has been created, it may be moved into another group or moved to the root level by dragging the folder icon and dropping it where the user would like it to remain.</p>
