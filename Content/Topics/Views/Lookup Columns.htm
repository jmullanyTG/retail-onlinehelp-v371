        <h1 >Lookup Columns</h1>
        <p>The lookup columns can be configured to increase the usability of the pivot grid widget by referencing lookup data and presenting it to the user in a more familiar or more user friendly format.</p>

        <p>The lookup column must be accompanied by a method (stored procedure) which will return the lookup data (e.g. If the returned data is the product status ID (which is an INT 1-10) and the user wants to change it, the lookup column will run a separate query to the database to give the associate friendly name text values for the 1-10 IDs based on a <span style="font-family: Consolas;color: #0000FF;font-size: 10pt;">SELECT</span> from a different table).</p>
