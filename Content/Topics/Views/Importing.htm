        <h1 >Importing</h1>
        <p>Within the “Maintain Widgets” window, clicking on the “Import” button will open up the windows file manager and allow users to open the folder containing the “.widgetf” file they intend to import. Once imported, the file will be located in a folder container labeled “import” followed by an 18 digit number string (this is actually the datetime in ticks!) which may be used to link the widget to any simultaneously imported parameters. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The imported widget will function as designed if left in its import folder, however, for ease of navigation, it is suggested that users move the widget to the proper folder. </p>
