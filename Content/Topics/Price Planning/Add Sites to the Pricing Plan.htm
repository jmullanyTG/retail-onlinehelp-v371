        <h1 >Add Sites to the Pricing Plan</h1>
        <p>To include additional sites in the Pricing Plan, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span> on the Pricing Plan Site grid, which will display the Sites Filter window. Select an existing filter or click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintain Filters</span> to create a new filter. Once a filter is selected click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> to append the new sites to the existing site listing and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> to commit any changes.</p>
        <p>If active Pricing Action(s) exist, the system will allow you to apply the new sites using the Actionâ€™s Summary level entered values. If you are unable to add sites, the Pricing Action may be in a status that does not allow modification with your rights.</p>

        <p><span class="Heading2Char">Modify </span><span class="Heading2Char">Plan Start Date</span>
            <br />When modifying the Plan Start Date, the system will restrict moving the date forward any further than by any Pricing Action Start Date.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example</span>: <br />Original Plan Start Date = 01/01/2016<br />Earliest Price Action Start Date (already exported) = 02/01/2016<br />Result: System will not allow a new Plan Start Date greater than 02/01/2016</p>
        <p><span class="Heading2Char">Remove p</span><span class="Heading2Char">roducts from the Pricing Plan</span>
            <br />To remove products from the Pricing Plan, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove</span> on the Pricing Plan Variant grid. The solution provides two (2) methods to identify products to be removed: manually selected or using the system clipboard.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Manual Selection</p>
        <p>To remove products from the Pricing Plan, select and mark the checkbox adjacent to the appropriate product(s) in the Pricing Plan Variant grid and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Selected</span>.</p>
        <p>The system will not allow removal of product(s) from the Pricing Plan if the product(s) are being used in a Pricing Action.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Remove from Clipboard</p>
        <p>You will be able to remove products directly from their system clipboard with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove from Clipboard</span> button. The copied list should have one (1) product (i.e. Variant or Item Master, global policy) per line, followed by a carriage return line feed.</p>
        <p>The system will validate all entries and will log all failed products for investigation by you. For successful entries and upon your confirmation, the system will remove the products and recalculate the Pricing Action(s).</p>
