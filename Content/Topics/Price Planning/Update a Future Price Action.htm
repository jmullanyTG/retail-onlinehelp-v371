        <h1 >Update a Future Price Action</h1>
        <p>Depending on the Price Planning solution configuration to either have the system automatically update Price Actions with new Site Products, Cost and Price Changes or to force you to review and manually update may cause the Pricing Plan ‘Update’ icon to appear.</p>
        <p>Double clicking the ‘Update’ icon will display the ‘Update Plan’ window. Select the appropriate products for the system to update across any future Price Actions and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add &amp; Recalculate</span>. Historic Price Actions (i.e. Start Date occurs in the past) and Price Actions that are already exported will not be updated. If any of the selected Products were ‘excluded’ from the future Price Actions, no updates will be made. Any unselected Products will be dismissed.</p>
