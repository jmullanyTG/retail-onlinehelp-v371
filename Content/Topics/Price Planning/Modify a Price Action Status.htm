        <h1 >Modify a Price Action Status</h1>
        <p>The Price Action Status provides the ability to drive corporate configured processes and associated permissions by roles and users, for each Status, as well as provide communication(s) between Statuses that can be reviewed to understand the lifecycle of the Pricing Action. Modifying the Status may change a user’s ability to continue modify the Price Action.</p>
        <p>A Price Action must be in a ‘calculated’ state, before the system will allow the Status to be modified. You must also have permissions, in the current Status and Validation state, to modify the Status. Next available Statuses are also controlled by your Workflow permissions. </p>
        <p>To modifying the Status, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Status</span> and select the new Status. The Price Action can also be assigned a new Owner, either a specific User or Role. Click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span> to confirm the Status change and close the window, otherwise click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span>.</p>
