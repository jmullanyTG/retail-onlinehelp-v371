        <h1 >Add Products to the Pricing Plan</h1>
        <p>To include additional products in the Pricing Plan, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span> on the Pricing Plan Variant grid. The solution provides two methods to identify additional products: using filter criteria or using the system clipboard. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Filter</p>
        <p>Clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Filter</span> will display the filter window so that you can choose an existing filter or click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintain Filters</span> to create a new filter. Once a filter is selected click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> to append any new products to the existing product listing and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> to commit any changes.</p>
        <p>If active Pricing Action(s) exist, the system will allow you to apply the new products using the Actionâ€™s Summary level entered values. If you are unable to add products, the Pricing Action may be in a status that does not allow modification with your rights.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Clipboard</p>
        <p>You will be able to add products directly from their system clipboard with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Clipboard</span> button. The copied list should have one (1) product (i.e. Variant or Item Master, global policy) per line, followed by a carriage return line feed.</p>
        <p>The system will validate all entries and will log all failed products for investigation by you. Successful entries will be added to the Pricing Plan and the system will allow you to act immediately on the new products by adding to a Pricing Action. </p>
