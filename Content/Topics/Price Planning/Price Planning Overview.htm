        <h1 class="Heading1">Price Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>JustEnough Price Planning enables you to control the complete lifecycle pricing of products – from initial price to price adjustments and markdowns through to end of life. Prices can be created at any level of the product hierarchy with a complete view of current inventory, price elasticity and product rate of sale.</p>
        <p>The result is pricing that meets legal and corporate compliance while effectively managing product price lifecycles so that margins and customer satisfaction are maximized. </p>
        <p>The solution includes a powerful rules engine that includes calculations and validations. This allows you to create and enforce rules for internal and external purposes. For example, competitor, rounding, vendor, legal compliance and financial rules. Multiple rules can be designed to guide you through a defined workflow and approval process.</p>
        <p>As people are managing plans, they have immediate visibility into any potential problems before the plans are submitted. This reduces the planning process timeline, allowing for faster reaction to market conditions. The exceptions can also be made visible in the dashboard, focusing on the elements that require attention.</p>
        <p>During the planning process, you have visibility to the entire price lifecycle of their categories and products. In one unified view, they can see regular, promotional, markdown and clearance prices. This helps you to quickly and easily identify overlaps and decide on pricing cadence.</p>
