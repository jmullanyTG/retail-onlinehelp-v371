        <h1 >Exclude Products from the Price Action</h1>
        <p>Selection of a Price Action, in the Price Actions screen, will populate the Price Action Detail grid with the applicable Variants. To exclude a Variant, mark the checkbox adjacent to the Variant and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exclude</span>.</p>
        <p>Once the exclusion is confirmed, the system will display the excluded Variant(s) with a strike through. Excluding Variants from the Price Action Detail Grid will cause removal across <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> configured Sites meaning that the system will not implement any Price Strategy calculations nor validations for any Products within the Variant. </p>
