        <h1 >User Notification Inbox</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the Notification Icon and Inbox is to provide you with a method of communication from the system that a process they initiated (e.g. a long running calculation or forecast) has been submitted, completed, cancelled, expired or failed.</p>
        <p>The Notification Inbox can be accessed by clicking the Notification icon found at the top right. The notification icon will also display the number of unread notifications. </p>
        <p>You may dismiss Notifications that no longer are relevant thus removing them from immediate view. The dismissed notifications will be kept for a period of time and can be viewed by clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span> toggle before they are purged by a schedule process.</p>
        <p>The Notification Inbox can be moved to another screen, if needed, and sorted by Date/Time by default. Unread notifications will be highlighted. </p>
