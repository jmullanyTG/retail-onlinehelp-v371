        <h1>Allocation</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Allocation module. </p>
        <h2>Product groups now built from allocation strategies</h2>
        <p>Product groups are now composed of allocation strategies instead of variants. The major impact of this change is that omni-channel organizations can now create channel-specific product groups, which was not previously possible.  &#160;Before, adding a variant to a product group meant all of the allocation strategies associated with that variant were automatically and irrevocably included in that group. Now, for example, if an item has a different allocation strategy per channel, a user can choose just the specific strategies they want to include in a product group. The strategies that are not included in the product group will remain available for other uses.</p>
        <p>The steps for creating and maintaining product groups in the Allocations module do not change as a result of this enhancement. What has changed in the UI&#160;is that the grid at the bottom of the Product Groups pane now shows eligible allocation strategies instead of eligible variants.</p>

        </p>
        <p>New fields in the grid include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allocation Strategy ID&#160;</li>
            <li>Eligible Channel</li>
            <li>Location Strategy</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note</b>: To align existing product groups to the new architecture, this enhancement requires a migration step during upgrade. See <a href="Breaking Changes.htm">Breaking Changes</a> for more information.</p>
