        <h1>Merchandise Financial Planning</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Financial Planning module. </p>
        <h2>Consolidation of planning views </h2>
        <p>A single new planning view replaces the 3 planning views (Main Planning View, Comp/Non-Comp Planning View, and Sales By Type Planning View) that appeared in previous versions. All fields from the previous views are available in the new Hybrid Financial Planning Grid.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Auto Lock on Cell Change</b><![CDATA[  ]]></h2>
        <p>You can now have sales-related cell values automatically lock themselves after you update them.&#160;When the new <b>Auto Lock on Cell Change</b> is enabled, each time you change the value of a sales-related metric in the grid, the system automatically locks the changed cell  as well as its related sales cells. This saves you from having to stop and lock each cell after each change, which is especially convenient when you want to to change a number of values in a plan.</p>
        <p>The <b>Auto Lock on Cell Change</b> option is located in the Calculation Direction Toggles pane. Simply click its checkbox to toggle enabling and disabling the option.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Save/Restore Data Layout </h2>
        <p>To complement the existing Layout feature, which saves and restores the pivots, filters, and data fields displayed in the Hybrid Financial Planning Grid, a new <b>data layout</b> feature is now available.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;">The<b> Save/Restore Data Layout</b> context menu option lets you save and restore only the fields used as metrics in the data area of the planning grid, <i>independently</i> of the pivot fields used to aggregate the data into rows and columns. This lets you easily switch metrics in a layout without having to recreate your current product/location/time dimensions and filters.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Restore Data Layout.png" class="SS" />
        </p>
        <p>Data layouts take the pain out of switching between different areas of a financial plan. For example, you can choose a layout that contains the pivots  (channel, product, and time periods) and filters for the areas of the plan you are responsible for. As you work on your plan, if you want to see a different set of metrics while preserving the current pivots and filters, you can simply select a new data layout and only the data fields displayed in the grid will change. Your workspace, pivots, and filters will persist until you choose to change them. This versatility lets you use layouts to drive your work, making it easy to switch scenarios without sacrificing time or convenience.</p>
        <h2>New folder structure for organizing saved layouts </h2>
        <p>Using different layouts for different tasks can make working on financial plans much easier. Now you can better organize your layouts by saving them in folders.</p>
        <p>When saving a layout, simply choose the group you want to save the layout in.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Save Layout - Group field.png" class="SS" />
        </p>
        <p>The next time you want to use that layout, you can choose it from that group in the Restore Layout context menu.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Creating a layout group requires administrator privileges.</p>
        <h2>Supply chain validation behavior</h2>
        <p>Supply chains are now validated on master plans only, and their validation status is passed down to branch plans. </p>
        <p>Also, the Supply Chain Status value is now colored red when the supply chain fails validation. This replaces the warning message that would pop up when opening a plan in previous versions. </p>
