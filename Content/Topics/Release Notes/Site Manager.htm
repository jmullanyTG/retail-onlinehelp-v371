        <h1>Site Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Site Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Product Exclusion Sets</h2>
        <p>The Site Product Exclusion feature has been redesigned to provide greater flexibility and convenience. In previous versions, product exclusions had to be defined on a site-by-site basis and could be based on either a filter or hierarchy level. Now, you can create reusable product exclusion sets based on combinations of item filters and product hierarchy levels. Once created, a product exclusion set can be quickly assigned to any site in the Site Manager Grid.</p>

        <h3>New items</h3>
        <p>The following items have been added to support this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Metadata</b>: Two new fields are now available:<ul><li><b>Product Exclusion Exists</b> - Indicates whether or not a product exclusion set has been applied to the selected site.</li><li><b>Product Exclusion Set</b> - Specifies the product exclusion set applied to the site.</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Site Manager Detail tab</b>:The Site Product Exclusion Set tab replaces the previous Site Product Exclusion tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Migration of existing site product exclusions</h3>
        <p>If upgrading from a previous version of Demand Management, any existing site product exclusions will be migrated to new product exclusion sets during the upgrade process. For more information, see the Demand Management Installation Guide.</p>
