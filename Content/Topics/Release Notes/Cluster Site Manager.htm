        <p>The following enhancement is now available in the Cluster Site Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Price module added</h2>
        <p>Site cluster sets can now be configured for use with Price Manager. A new option in the Modules field, Price, identifies a cluster set as being available for use in the Price Manager module. This option is available to both new and existing site cluster sets.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Additionally, a Price column has been added to the Cluster Set Management window to identify cluster sets that have the Price option selected.</p>
