        <h1>Replenishment</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements have been made to the JustEnough replenishment process.</p>
        <h2>Drop Ship Schedules</h2>
        <p>Orders shipped directly from suppliers may require different schedules than "normal" shipping and receiving schedules. A new field, Drop Ship Schedule, lets you assign a schedule to use specifically for direct supplier orders. This field is available in the Item Manager and Site Manager modules.</p>
