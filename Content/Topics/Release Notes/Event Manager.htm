        <h1>Event Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Event Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Slot renumbering improvements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can now undo and redo slot numbering changes by clicking <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> on the toolbar.</li>
            <li>The UI now asks if you want to save or cancel changes when exiting the Slot Renumbering feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Resizing slots</h2>
        <p>You can now adjust the borders of individual and multi-selected slots to create custom-sized slots on a slot set. </p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Only one border can be re-sized at a time.</p>
        <h3>Resizing a single slot</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click in a slot to select it. The "resizable"&#160;borders are indicated in purple.</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hover your mouse pointer over the border you want to resize. Wait for the mouse pointer to change to the "resize" cursor and then click-and-drag the border to its new position. </p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Resizing multiple slots</h3>
        <p>You can resize multiple slots at once as long as the slots are adjacent and aligned across at least one border.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Hold the Ctrl button while clicking in the slots you want to select. Slot borders turn orange when a slot is selected.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
