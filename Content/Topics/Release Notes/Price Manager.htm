        <h1>Price Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Price Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Site cluster sets replace site filters</h2>
        <p>Site cluster sets have replaced site filters as the method of selecting sites for pricing plans and price actions. (See the related <a href="Cluster Site Manager.htm">Cluster Site Manager</a> enhancement for making site cluster sets eligible for selection in Price Manager.) </p>
        <p>This change is reflected in the following areas of the Price Manager module:</p>
        <h3>Pricing plan changes</h3>
        <ul>

                <h3>Migration of site data from existing plans and actions</h3>
