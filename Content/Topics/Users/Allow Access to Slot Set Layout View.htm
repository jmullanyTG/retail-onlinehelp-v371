        <h1 >Allow Access to Slot Set Layout View</h1>
        <p>Provides access to the Layout and Versions screens to view the selected Slot Set as a visual representation of Promotions and Content. From the Layout screen, you may edit the Slot layout, add, create, delete and move Promotions, view and edit Bids and modify Content. Access to these tasks will depend on your assigned User Rights and the User Rights Blacklist for the Event Workflow Status State. The Versions screen provides a preview of the Slot Set color version(s) which are determined by unique combinations of promotional content and pricing assigned to distribution points (e.g. geographies, demographics, segmentations, etc.)</p>
