        <p>Some User Rights may be incorporated into Event Workflow Status States, while others are not affected by Event Status. User Rights need to be granted at a global level, but can be temporarily taken away by Event Workflow Status State using the User Rights Blacklist. For more information, see “Restrict User/Role Permissions” in Workflow State Manager Standard Documentation to understand blacklisting User Rights during specific Event Status States.</p>
