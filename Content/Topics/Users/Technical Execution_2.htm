        <p>Within the JustEnough user interface, there are several hundred rights which may be included or excluded from individual users or roles. Rights may be set to invisible (which will not disable the right), in which case they may not be viewed in the user interface and must be manipulated within the SQL table (tbl_right). All versions 3.0-3.2 and earlier will contain rights applicable to IOv6 which will NOT affect the current user interface.</p>
