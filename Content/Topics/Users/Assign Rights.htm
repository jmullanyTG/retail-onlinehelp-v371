        <h1 >Assign Rights</h1>
        <p>The assign rights tab within the “user information” window will allow administrators to add one or more rights to a user account. The rights are grouped and may be added a group at a time, or individually. </p>

        </p>
        <p>If one right from the group is included or excluded, the group header will appear on that side. This is not an indication that the entire group has been added.</p>
