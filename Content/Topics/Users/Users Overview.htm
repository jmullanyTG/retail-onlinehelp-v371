        <p>The JustEnough Users Module is an administrative tool used to se tup user rights, roles, and groups for a particular module and sub-sections of modules. Roles may be configured with required rights, and users belonging to that role will inherit those rights. Further specific right configuration per user may be applied from that point.</p>
        <p>Within the Users tab of the navigation menu, administrators may manage individual user accounts. Tasks such as account creation, information manipulation, account deletion, and assignment of rights and roles are all accomplished in the users tab.</p>
