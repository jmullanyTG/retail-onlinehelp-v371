        <h1 >Synchronize From Active Directory</h1>
        <p>If desired, users may be maintained based on active directory entries in a particular domain. This should be done only with consultation with the client IT department. Standard practice when syncing with active directory would be to leave the “enhanced mode” box unchecked. </p>

        </p>
        <p>If the desired results are not returned, the sync may be run in enhanced mode, which will circumvent the API. It is not recommended for use unless absolutely required.</p>
