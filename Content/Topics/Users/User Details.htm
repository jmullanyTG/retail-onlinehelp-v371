        <h1 >User Details</h1>
        <p>Within the user information window, the user details tab will contain most of the general information common to software user accounts, such as login credentials and password information, as well as assigned filters.</p>
        <p>The concept of assigned filters will give an administrative user the ability to segment sections of the company data in order to restrict users, or streamline their individual workflows. Users may be assigned filters built on specific inventories, sites, item masters and many other filter types. </p>
