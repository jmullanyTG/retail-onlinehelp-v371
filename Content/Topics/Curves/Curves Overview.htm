        <h1 class="Heading1">Curves Overview</h1>
        <p>The Curves module is a management screen for data used in other modules of JustEnough, such as the Profiles Module and Assortment Planning Module. </p>
        <p>Curves are generated within JustEnough using data which has been imported into the system. They may also be imported as-is using the standard import mechanism. </p>
        <h2 >Essential Business Concepts</h2>
        <p>The important concept to understand when using the curves module is that it is a representation of the available data, and not the interface though which the data is applied. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name – </span>The name for the individual curve. May be concatenated out of several associated tags. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Generation Type –</span> The method by which the curve was generated. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manual Curve –</span> When creating a manual curve, the values must be entered by hand. A default value may be specified to set the scale. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Specified Conditions –</span> A programmatically generated curve using a selected data sample.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bucket Type –</span> The type of time period used for the x-axis. Bucket types may be daily, weekly, or monthly, but should be selected to support the data. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start Date –</span> The effective start date for the sample. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">End Data –</span> The effective end date for the sample. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of Periods –</span> The number of periods contained in the curve. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 >Tags</h4>
        <p>Tags are used within the curves module as an attribute in order to help sort and categorize curves. They are distinctly different from the other forms of tags within the system. When selecting curves to view, they may be filtered based on available tags. </p>
        <h3 >Filter Configuration</h3>
        <p>The filter configuration section will display all available groups (item master, inventory, and site) for inclusion. The order setting will allow users to effectively construct their hierarchy (product, site, etc.) and include the appropriate values for the curve filters. </p>
        <h3 >Tag Configuration</h3>
        <p>Curve tags are used to give the individual curves searchable attributes. Curve tags may be added or removed within the “Maintain Curve Tags” wizard. </p>
        <h2 >Practical Application</h2>
        <p>Creating and maintaining the curves is largely managed through the curves wizard. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The curve may be named and security rights added at the time of creation. If desired, tags may be applied using the “Tag Links” button. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Curves/Curves Overview_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 532px;height: 426px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Remaining details will be added in the second wizard screen. Filter values must be entered.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once built, users may choose to preview the curve.</p>

        <h2 >Technical Execution</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Curve data is stored in the database under the <span style="font-family: Consolas;color: #008080;font-size: 10pt;">tbl_curve </span>namespace. </p>
