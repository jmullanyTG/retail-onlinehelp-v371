            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Requires Configuration –</span> Configuration elements are missing.

            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration Changed –</span> Configuration elements have changed and a plan calculation is required. Any results currently displayed within the scenario details section are related to the previous configuration and are considered to be “stale”.

            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ready to Calculate –</span> Once configuration is complete, the plan status will update to “ready to calculate” and the draft engine may be run.
