        <p>Creation of choice count models is managed within the choice count screen. Like all management screens within the Adaptive Allocations module, it may be undocked from JustEnough and realigned or moved to a secondary monitor by clicking and dragging the tab to the desired location. </p>
        <p>Users may create and configure choice count models for consumption during the scenario plan building phase within the choice count model grid.</p>
