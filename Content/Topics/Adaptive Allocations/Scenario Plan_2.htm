        <h1 >Scenario Plan </h1>
        <p>Creation of scenario plans is managed within the scenario plan screen. Like all management screens within the Adaptive Allocations module, it may be undocked from JustEnough and realigned or moved to a secondary monitor by clicking and dragging the tab to the desired location. </p>

        </p>
        <p>New plans may be created by selecting “New”. </p>
        <p>Users will be required to fill in all fields before saving. Access level will default to “public” unless otherwise specified. If any configuration details are deleted, previously executed plan results will not be altered, however, any plans which includes a deleted configuration element will not recalculate (plan status will update to “Configuration Changed”).</p>
