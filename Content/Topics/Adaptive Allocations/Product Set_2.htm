        </p>
        <p>New sets may be created by selecting “New”. </p>
        <p>Users will be required to fill in all fields and save before the variant detail configuration sections become available. Access level will default to “public” unless otherwise specified. </p>
        <p>Selection sets (even linked selection sets) may be deleted for users with appropriate permissions by highlighting row and selecting “Delete”.</p>
        <p>If any changes made within the variant details sections, users will be unable to navigate away without a “save” or “undo” action. This is represented by graying out the product set view. </p>
