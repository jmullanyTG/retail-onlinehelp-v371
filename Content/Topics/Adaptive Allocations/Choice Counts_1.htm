        <h1 >Choice Counts</h1>
        <p>The choice counts view will display the calculated choice counts as used in the draft process for each store. For the purposes of comparison, the historical choice count during the historical period is also displayed alongside the calculated result. Given similar financial targets, the choice count model will likely yield fewer counts than the comparative historical count due in part to the qualification thresholds. </p>
