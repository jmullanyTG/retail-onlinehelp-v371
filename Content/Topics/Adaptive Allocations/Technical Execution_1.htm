        <h1 >Attribute Weighting </h1>
        <p>As part of the attribute inclusion process, users are prompted to supply a “weighting factor” which is used to determine the importance of the attribute within the draft process versus the other included attributes. All values default to “100%”, which means that they are evenly weighted. </p>
