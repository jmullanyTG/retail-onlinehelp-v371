        <h1 >Engine Replays</h1>
        <p>If it becomes necessary to de-bug the draft engine, or investigate the results, it may be run with a “Save Replay” option. The “Save Replay” button may be added to the scenario plan user interface through a separate user right. Replay recipients may be configured in the Engine.ReplayDestinations system policy; this value may be either comma separated email addresses or a file path destination (located on the services tier machine). </p>
