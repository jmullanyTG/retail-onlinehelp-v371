        <h1 >Location Plan</h1>
        <p>Within Location Planning, financial targets are created for levels of the product hierarchy down to store level. The creation of a location plan based demand plan within Adaptive Allocations, the mechanism is similar to that of strategic financial planning, but without the need of a product model, as store level indexing is not necessary. </p>
        <p>For the given example, the location plan values are as follows:</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Adaptive Allocations/Location Plan_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 545px;height: 321px;" /></p>
        <p>The time frame (set via “Plan Length” in a linked scenario plan) was set in such a way to include weeks 1-5 of the plan. For the given example, if “include core products” was unselected, the contribution of core products for weeks 1-5 would be removed from the overall target values. </p>
