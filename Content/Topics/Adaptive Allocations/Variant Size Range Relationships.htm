        <h1 >Variant-Size Range Relationships</h1>
        <p>Once a size range has been configured to cover the breadth of sizes for a variant (a configured data entity, typically relates to “style-color”), a variant-size range relationship should be configured. These size ranges will likely be built in reference to a specific level of the product hierarchy (e.g. women’s tops). This may be done through the Variant Manager. The Size Range Name field will return available size ranges.</p>
