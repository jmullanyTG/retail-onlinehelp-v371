        <h1 >Attribute Management</h1>
        <p>As Adaptive Allocations is reliant on the existence of product attributes in order to make informed decisions; the existence of basic product attributes is required, with increasing capabilities based on the availability of additional attributes. Product attributes may be imported (along with their relationships to products) from an external system, or created and managed within the JustEnough Attribute Manager if otherwise unavailable. For additional information, please see the Attribute Manager documentation. </p>
