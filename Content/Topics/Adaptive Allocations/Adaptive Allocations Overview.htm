        <h1 class="Heading1">Adaptive Allocations Overview</h1>
        <p>Adaptive Allocations is a new extension of the JustEnough Allocation solution that automates the creation and allocation of localized assortments. Adaptive Allocations determines an optimal mix of products utilizing a revolutionary draft engine and data analytics for locations and products to fulfill a need that can be set through financial planning, location planning and other cover methods. </p>
        <p>Adaptive Allocations can bridge the gap in Inventory Management between a full strategic approach to allocating products to locations and the dispersal miscellaneous (e.g. broken size run, leftover product, etc.) products through allocations groups.</p>
        <p>While Adaptive Allocations shares many concepts with Assortment Planning, it is in no way meant to replace Assortment Planning; the additional complexity and detail required to properly execute Assortment Planning will provide a higher degree of precision in the final output. </p>
        <p>In order to create allocation orders which may be executed within the JustEnough Order Manager, the Adaptive Allocations process will require users to create a demand plan from an array of available sources, which will in turn drive the choice count process as well as the overall output volumes of the scenario plan. Additionally, a product set comprised of the desired products to be allocated will be configured and any attributes associated with those products should be selected for inclusion and their priorities weighted. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Together, the JustEnough Draft Engine will use the store level need targets and choice counts to select the optimal products based on attribute affinity and in the appropriate volumes. </p>
