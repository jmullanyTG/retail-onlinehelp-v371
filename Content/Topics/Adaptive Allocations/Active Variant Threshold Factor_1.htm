        <p>The percent of each store-variant’s average sales which will set the minimum threshold for de-seasonalized values. This value is available for use when calculating longer sales periods with highly seasonal products within the sample, but is otherwise not applicable to many common Adaptive Allocations scenarios. System default value for this threshold is “0”. </p>
