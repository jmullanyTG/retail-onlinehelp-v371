        <p>The variant details view will allow users to determine the sub-set of variants within the filter which should be included in the product set. Upon creation or alteration of a product set, the variant details views will refresh based on the supplied parameters. Please note: if “Opt-In” is selected, on any change to the product set, the list of variants within the variant details view will all be selected (even if they were previously un-selected).</p>
