        <h1 >Minimum % of Selling Periods Threshold</h1>
        <p>Compares the remaining qualified periods against the total count of selling periods in the specified time frame, then qualifies the variant if it meets or exceeds the threshold. </p>
        <p>In the given example, the weeks 1-7 for 2016 have been set as the time frame for the sample. The sales volume % of max threshold value has been set to 15% and minimum % of selling periods threshold has been set to 50%.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Given the qualification, weeks 4-7 have been disqualified, thus failing to meet the 50% of qualified periods requirement; this variant is therefore disqualified from the choice count calculation. </p>
