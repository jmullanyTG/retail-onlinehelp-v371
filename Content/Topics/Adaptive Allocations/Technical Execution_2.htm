        <h1 >Technical Execution</h1>
        <p>Before calculating, several steps are taken to remove anomalies from the data that would skew subsequent calculations. The most common causes of inaccuracies when using historical sales to calculate future projections via a simple average are, that the item wasnâ€™t available for sale during part of all of the window of time (if averaging the entire window of time, zeros may be included, if averaging non-zero periods only, those values may not be representative of a true average period during the window of time), and the item had low stock levels, thus impacting sales.</p>
