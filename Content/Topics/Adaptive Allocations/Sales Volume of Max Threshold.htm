        <h1 >Sales Volume % of Max Threshold </h1>
        <p>For each variant and site in the sample, the total value is calculated per period (by cost or price depending on accounting method system policy value); the maximum value of the sampled periods is used as the anchor point of the calculation. The sales volume % of max threshold value is then used to validate each data point within the series. </p>
        <p>In the given example, the weeks 1-7 for 2016 have been set as the time frame for the sample. The sales volume % of max threshold value has been set to 15%. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The maximum value of selling periods is $1,000.00 in week 2. With a sales volume % of max threshold value set to 15%, the minimum sales dollars must meet or exceed $150.00 for the period to be included. Given the qualification, the sales data from week 7 must be excluded for the choice count calculation. </p>
