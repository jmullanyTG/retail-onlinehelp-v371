        <h1 >Creating Orders in Adaptive Allocations</h1>
        <p>Once a scenario plan has been calculated it will be in a plan status state of “Ready to Execute”. From that plan status state, it may be converted to orders, thus “finalizing” the plan. Once it has been finalized, the scenario plan becomes read only (this is done to prevent duplication of orders). </p>

        </p>
        <p>For any calculated scenario plan, the “Generate Order” button will become enabled. Once selected, users will be prompted to approve the finalization of the scenario. </p>

        <p>Upon approval, the orders will be opened within an Order Manager document.</p>
