        <h1 >Demand Plan Results</h1>
        <p>Once a demand plan has been associated to a scenario plan (and thus associating values within the site dimension via a location strategy) and calculating the results, users are able to view the by store need target values in the demand plan results section. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scenario Plan – </span>A drop down list of all scenario plans associated with the highlighted demand plan. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Code –</span> The unique code for the site. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Description –</span> Description for the site. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Need Target –</span> The total need target for the site based on the demand plan. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Groups 1-20 – </span>Optional groupings used within the location dimension may be returned (e.g. channel, etc.) to further assist with need target validations. These values will appear based on names specified as part of the common table definition process during the solution design. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Demand plan results are calculated in a common “base currency” instead of unit targets in order to better represent coverage across a category with a diversity of AUR/AUC values. </p>
