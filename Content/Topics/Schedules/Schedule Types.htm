        <h1>Schedule Types</h1>
        <p>JustEnough lets you create multiple types of schedules for sites and DCs. Each affects the lead time that JustEnough factors in when determining the date an order needs to be placed.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Drop Ship Schedule - </b>Use for direct supplier orders that do not follow your normal shipping and receiving schedules. </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Order Processing Schedule - </b>This schedule sets the dates when staff is available to process orders at store or DC. It is used to derive the actual number of lead time days needed to process orders at the site. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Receiving Schedule – </span>Receiving schedules set the dates on which a store or DC may receive stock. These schedules can ensure busy stores receive stock shipments during times with less foot traffic, or when staff is available for processing. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shipping Schedule –</span> Shipping schedules set the dates on which an order may be placed against a store or DC. It is assumed that any location is able to ship on the same day that an order is placed.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transportation Schedule –</span> Transportation schedules set the dates on which transportation of stock to a store or DC is available ("truck" schedules, etc.). When calculating lead times for shipments to a receiving site, JustEnough uses the destination site's transportation schedule to determine what days transportation to the destination site is available. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note</b>: A schedule set can be used in any type of schedule. </p>
