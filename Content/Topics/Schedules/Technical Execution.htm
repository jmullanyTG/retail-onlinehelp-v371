        <p>Schedules may be resolved at a glance within the summary view on the schedule page. Detailed resolutions including affected dates may be viewed by clicking on the “Details” button. Within the Schedule Trigger Event Date Times view, users may select a range start and range end to view all of the affected dates bound by the range. The default range end will be one week from today’s date; this may require adjustment to view long running trigger events. </p>
