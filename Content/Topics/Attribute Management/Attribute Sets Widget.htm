        <h1>Attribute Sets Widget</h1>
        <p>On loading the screen, users will have the ability to create a new attribute set. This process is fairly straight forward as they will only have to fill in the following fields:</p>
        <p>Set Name – Name the set with a descriptive name to indicate what attributes it may contain e.g. Shoe Attribute Set</p>
        <p>Entity Types – As described above, each attribute set can be assigned certain entity types, If the user wishes certain attribute families to be available in a set, they have to associate the entity types that are appropriate for the attribute families. For Assortment Planning, the Variant and the Variant Placeholder entity types must be included for an attribute set.</p>
