        <h4 >Filter Links</h4>
        <p>Selecting a filter link will link all items contained within a filter to the specific causal. This especially helpful with dynamic filters, as the items contained within the filter can change over time. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Users have the option to choose the entity type to which they wish to establish a causal filter link.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Inventory, item master, site, and variant entity filters may be linked with the actual causal link applying at the constituent inventory level. </p>
        <p>Selected items from the filter may be removed from the causal link by highlighting them and pressing the “delete” button. For more information on a specific item, it may be highlighted and “view” may be clicked, which will launch an Item Manager view. </p>
        <p>If the items are not appearing in the grid, items with a mismatched bucket type to that of the causal may have been selected.</p>
