        <h1>Causals Overview</h1>
        <p>Causals tell JustEnough when specific periods of increased demand for your items should not be used to forecast normal demand.</p>
        <p>For example, when a promotion is run on an item, demand typically increases. However, if JustEnough's forecasting engine is not aware that a promotion ran during the period of increased demand, it interprets the increase as an increase in "normal" demand and will&#160;forecast&#160;higher future demand for the item accordingly. To prevent this from happening, you can use a <i>causal</i> to tell JustEnough that the increased demand was caused by the promotion. JustEnough then knows not to count that increased demand as "normal" when it generates forecasts for the item.</p>
        <p> There are four types of causals which can be created in the JustEnough system:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 37pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">(normal)&#160;Causal</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manual Causal</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Event</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Informational Causal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For descriptions of each causal type, see <a href="General Information.htm">General Information</a>.</p>
