        <h3 >Negative Normal Causals</h3>
        <p>The behavior of a negative value within normal causals is controlled via the system policy “<span style="color: #000000;">Forecast_IgnoreNegativeCausals”, which defaults to a value of “false”. If set to “true” the causal application logic will </span>ignore negative causals as it refers to the slope of the causal factor in relation to the sales data series; thus, negative causal factors are allowed to have negative effects (but not positive effects) when the option is set.</p>
