        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown</span> - The system includes a ‘default’ Status Type which is only used if the system is experiencing an issue and JustEnough Support should be contacted.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparing</span> (a.k.a. Batching) - The system is evaluating the Items in the submitted Batch and estimated workload.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Coalescing</span> - The system is marking Items in the submitted Batch to reduce processing time by removing duplicate items.

Prior Batches will complete the non-coalesced Items and then be placed into a Status of ‘purgatory’ until the last Batch, with ‘like’ Items, has been completed.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ready</span> - The system has completed preparation and coalescing the Batch making it ready to be executed by the Workload Queue Marshall.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Executing</span> - The system is executing the submitted Batch.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purgatory</span> - The Batch is waiting for a following Batch, with like Items, to be completed.</li>
