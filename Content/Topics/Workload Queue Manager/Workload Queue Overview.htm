        <h1 class="Heading1">Workload Queue Overview</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the Workload Queue is to determine and set the most efficient timeframe (i.e. Daily, Nightly, Weekend) of submitted work Batches, to be executed, to ensure the system provides results in an expedited manner.</p>
        <p>Each JustEnough solution (e.g. Inventory Forecasting, Assortment Planning, Adaptive Allocations, etc.) will have its workload defined at its lowest level. Based on the quantity of lowest level, within a submitted Batch, will allow the system to calculate the total expected time to process.</p>
        <p>Thresholds are set to determine if the total expected process time will be executed during the day (i.e. quick Batches), at night (i.e. longer Batches) or over the weekend (i.e. long Batches requiring extensive resource usage). </p>
        <p>Priority Order within each timeframe will be based on submission date and time. The Workload Queue also allows you, if you have specific permissions, to expedite processing Batches to the front of the queue.</p>
