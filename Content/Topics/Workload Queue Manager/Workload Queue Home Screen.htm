        <p>After submitting a Batch from a supported JustEnough solution (i.e. Inventory Forecast and Assortment Planning) the system will determine the number of Items and calculate the estimated workload to set the Batch’s priority to be displayed in the Workload Queue ‘Active’ list. </p>
        <p>Some Batches may be put into a status of Purgatory because it contains ‘like’ Items found in a Batch, or multiple Batches found in later Jobs. To maintain efficiency the system will only process those similar items in the last Batch. Once the last Batch has been completed the system will apply the results to the original Batch and complete.</p>
        <p>You can also use the Workload Queue screen to modify the priority of a submitted Batch or remove it from being processed. Any modifications to a Batch(s) priority must be committed by clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>. Clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancel</span> will revert any modifications to its original state. Once a Batch has begun execution, its priority cannot be modified further.</p>
        <p>Clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration</span> opens the Workload Queue Configuration dialog.</p>
