        <h1 >Optimization Tuning</h1>
        <p>The Workload Queue Optimization Tuning will calculate the level of ‘work’ the system will use to determine a submitted process to determine its priority. Initially these values are configured at the time of implementation based on guiding factors adjusted for customer specific customizations. When executing this feature, the system will review the historic logs files to determine a better estimate of work which will provide the system a better value to judge a submitted work’s priority.</p>
        <p>The ‘Workload Queue – Optimization Tuning’ should not be scheduled to run on a frequent basis; no less than 30 days.</p>
