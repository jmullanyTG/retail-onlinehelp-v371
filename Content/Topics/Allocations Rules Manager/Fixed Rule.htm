        <h3 >Fixed Rule</h3>
        <p>The fixed rule aggregates data across specifically selected sites (stores). In the given example stores 1001, 1003, 1005, and 1007 have been selected. Once the stores are selected, a specific class or combination of sub-classes must be selected. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Because a fixed rule is applied, the size distribution (size curve) will be applied the same way for each store. </p>

        <h4 >Advantages</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">You can specify the stores that you want the stock to go to</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">You can specify how much each store will get based on an indexed percentage</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">You can send out the same size ratio as the stock was bought in</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 >Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">It can only send out in one size ratio (the same as what was bought)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">You can only allocate to the stores that are specified in the rule</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">You have to choose the exact area you want to distribute. i.e. if you base the rule on a knit class, all products will be allocated based on the knit class sales</li>
        </ul>
