        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">The sections that follow describe the use of 4 related </span><span style="color: #000000;">v</span><span style="color: #000000;">iews that allow users to manage the various aspects of how currencies are dealt with by JustEnough Assortment Planning. The parameters set in these views contribute to the calculation of proper blended AUR (average unit retail) pricing in implementations with multiple c</span><span style="color: #000000;">urrencies and countries in play, but are also used in single-currency/country implementations – they are just set to maintain flat pricing with no adjustments. That said, the configuration of these views is a required step in the implementation of Assortment Planning and should be completed prior to the creation of any assortment plans.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;color: #000000;">Some key concepts to be aware of as you enter this stage of system configuration are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 38pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Currency Assignments – </span>before configuring currency exchanges and price translations, home currencies need to be established for all sites that will be in use</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Updating Exchange Rates</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">–</span> <span style="color: #000000;">exchange rates from one currency to another are quite volatile, often changing multiple times within the span of a single week. A business discussion should be had around how often these rates need to be updated to plan effectively in your organization</span><span style="color: #000000;">, the source of the rates, and how they will be updated in the system</span><span style="color: #000000;">.&#160; While more frequent updating of rates might seem to yield a greater degree of accuracy, keep in mind that these changes will cause recalculations to occur within your assortment plans that users will need to review</span></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Price Translations vs. Price Matrix – </span>in past versions of JustEnough Assortment Planning, a Price Matrix was used to define premium pricing across multiple currencies. This has been replaced by Price Translation Rules with the version of Assortment Planning released in JustEnough version 3.5.3. This functionality allows users to define rules to adjust pricing by price range within each currency and then assign those rules to levels of the product hierarchy</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Updating VAT Rates –</span> VAT rates tend to be much less volatile than currency exchange rates, however they do change. Users have the ability to maintain VAT rates by any level of a given product hierarchy and by Site Groups 1-20, however <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assortment Planning was not designed to be used with product hierarchies that extend to the style/variant level</span>. That said, VAT rates should be maintained at a level above that, with any variations occurring beneath (due to fabric type in some countries, etc.) to be handled by entering a blended VAT rate for the level based on the expected % contribution of the products attached to varying VAT rates beneath. As with currency exchanges, a discussion should also be had about the frequency, source, and method of VAT rate updates</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 74pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Target Creation, with Assortment Planning, can be used as a purely analytical tool and could be useful in determining the % contribution of product types that exist beneath established product hierarchy levels (see </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Assortment Planning Standard Documentation &gt; Target Creation</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> for more information).</span>
