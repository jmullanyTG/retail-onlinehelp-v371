        <h2 ><a name="_Toc434937717"></a>Practical Application</h2>
        <p>Launching an aggregate forecast is done in the same way as an inventory level forecast, but with the “aggregate view” button. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>All functionality within an aggregate view will be identical to that in an inventory view. Aggregate views and inventory views may be opened at the same time in separate tabs, allowing users visibility into the item forecasts at several sites in addition to the aggregate forecast.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 ><a name="_Toc434937718"></a>Technical Execution</h2>
        <p>The aggregate forecast runs the exact same forecasting engine as the inventory level forecast. The only additional logic is the split factor logic, which is used to “dis-aggregate” the forecast and provide values at the inventory level which may be used for the purposes of replenishment. </p>
