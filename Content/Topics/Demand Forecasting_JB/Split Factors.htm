        <h1 class="Heading1">Split Factors</h1>
        <h3 >Split Factors</h3>
        <p>Split factors are created one of two ways: they may be system generated based on the existing inventory level forecasts, or they may be written in as custom split factors. There is no standard user interface for custom split factors.</p>
        <h4 >Split Modes</h4>
        <p>Higher level forecast types have multiple selectable split methods which may be applied by type through system polices. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Aggregate Item Sales – Aggregated inventory sales history (this may be set by inventory history or sales history by type, selectable through a system policy).</li>
            <li>Aggregate Site Sales (Applies to Aggregate Forecasting only) – Aggregated Sales at all sites.</li>
            <li>Temporal Forecast – Split using the forecast that varies by time period.</li>
            <li>Custom – Custom aggregate factors provided by end users or through a custom procedure.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A default split type for all forecast types will be set as a system policy, and each forecast type may be assigned a specific split type beyond the default. </p>
        <p>Aggregate Item Sales and Aggregate Site Sales are cached (usp_Forecast_Split_Calculate) whenever possible.&#160; In Group Forecasting, because a group forecast can vary depending upon which sales types a model uses, the factors are calculated real time.&#160; For Level, Aggregate, and Profile forecasts, the system expects cached entries; if no cached entries are found, a temporal forecast will be used to fill in missing factors.</p>
        <h4 >Split to Redundant / Split to Non-Stocked</h4>
        <p>Redundant and non-stocked inventory types require additional consideration when considering split logic. There are four possible ways in which splits may handles regarding redundant and non-stocked inventories:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Exclude – Will exclude values from both history and forecast, inventory is essentially ignored.</li>
            <li>Include – Will include values in both history and forecast.</li>
            <li>Partial Forecast – Will include the history and split assuming all items participate in the model, but will not record the results of the split for redundant / non-stocked inventories.</li>
            <li>Full Forecast – Will include the history and split to only those inventories which are not redundant / non-stocked.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Default split methodologies may be defined for redundant inventories and non-stocked inventories independently, or by forecast type, all through application of system polices. </p>
        <h4 >Effective Forecast Views</h4>
        <p>Standard views will store the effective forecast values for all higher level forecast types. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Uvw_Forecast_Group_Effective</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Uvw_Forecast_Profile_Effective</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Uvw_Forecast_Level_Effective</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Uvw_Forecast_Aggregate_Effective</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 >Cleanup Procedures</h4>
        <p>Cleanup procedures are provided to remove values for redundant and non-stocked inventories and remove inventories from models if they are no longer contained in the model filter. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Usp_Forecast_Cleanup</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Usp_FC_Groupforecast_Cleanup</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: These procedures will need to be added to daily/weekly jobs whenever forecasts are run.</p>
