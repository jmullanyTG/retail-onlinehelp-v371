        <h1 class="Heading1">Setting Overview</h1>
        <p>The settings tab within JustEnough does not contain modules as they are represented throughout other parts of the application. It does contain settings specific to the JustEnough shell, or user interface layer (UIL). Any changes which must be made to a specific user interface will be done through Settings.</p>
        <h2>Default settings</h2>
        <p>The following settings are available by default upon installation of JustEnough.</p>
        <h3>Auto Login</h3>
        <p>The auto login button, if checked, will log a user in after launching the shell stub. This will bypass the need to enter a password at launch. It is not recommended to be used on a shared workplace environment. When selected, the auto login button will appear to be highlighted (orange by default).</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Language Settings</h3>
        <p>The language settings button will launch the “language settings” window, which will allow the user to choose a language from the available translations for their instance of JustEnough.</p>
        <h3>Change User Password</h3>
        <p>Users may change their password after logging into the user interface. The “change user password” window will populate the username of the logged in user. Users will be asked to enter their current password, then the new password, and finally to confirm the new password. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Notification Preferences</h3>
        <p>The Notifications Preferences screen lets you customize how you want to receive notifications about specific JustEnough messages. Options are "hard", "soft", "silent", and "ignore". </p>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>The about window will display the version information for the JustEnough user interface, as well as pertinent connection information. </p>
        <h2>Advanced settings</h2>
        <p>The following settings are not installed by default. They must be added manually.</p>
        <h3>Download Module Updates From Server</h3>
        <p>The download module updates from server button, if checked, will automatically update the module files within the JustEnough user interface from the company server. If there are updates available, they will download immediately after logging in. When selected, the download module updates from server button will appear to be highlighted (orange by default).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Setup Plugin Folders</h3>
        <p>The “plugin folders configuration” window will allow users to specify the location of a particular folder which contains the desired version of the plugins for JustEnough.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/settings/Setting Overview_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 388px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Entries may be added, or deleted using the navigation buttons at the bottom of the window.</p>
        <p>If the plugins are not loading, make sure to check that there are valid plugin files contained within the filepath.</p>
        <h3>Load/Unload Plugins</h3>
        <p>Selecting load/unload plugins will prompt the JustEnough user interface to reload all of the plugin files from the specified plugin folders (or the default folder if none are specified). This will cause the JustEnough user interface to reset, however users will not be logged out. Any and all work which is open and not saved/committed must be saved before the user interface is reloaded.</p>
        <h3>Plugin Error Explorer</h3>
        <p>The “plugin error explorer” window will launch with a detailed explanation of any and all errors from the JustEnough plugins. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A detailed report of the XML exception which accompanies the error may be viewed in order to facilitate proper debugging. The exact error may be viewed by clicking the “view error” button. </p>
        <p>The “send error report” button will submit the full stack trace of the error to members of the JustEnough support team.</p>
