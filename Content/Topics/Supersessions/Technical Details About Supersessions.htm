        <h1><a name="_Technical_Details_About"></a>Technical Details About Supersessions</h1>
        <p>Supersession information is contained in the following three tables (note the spelling!):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>tbl_SupercessionHeader</b> - holds the information visible in the “Supersession Grid” within the user interface.</li>
            <li><b>tbl_SupercessionInventor</b>y  - holds the inventory links.</li>
            <li><b>tbl_SupercessionSite</b> – holds the site-specific replenishment types for the old items.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Linking a Supersession </h2>
        <p>In order for the forecasting engine to read the demand history from a linked supersession, the data will be written to tbl_InventoryHistory in the SupercessionHistoryQuantity column. If there are lost sales in the superseded (old item) history, they will come into tbl_InventoryHistory as SupercessionLostSalesQuantity. These may then be included or excluded at the user’s discretion along with regular lost sales quantities. </p>
        <p>Data will be copied for all time periods which fall within the “Sales History Start Date” and “Sales History End Date” window. </p>
