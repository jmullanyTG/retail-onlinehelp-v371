        <p>The trend processor rule will be commonly used in several forecast methods. It is used to “DeTrend” and then “ReTrend” the data series. What this means is that the pre-processor will take any apparent trend and remove it from the series, then re-add it during the post-processor.</p>
        <p>The only default parameter value for the trend processor rule is the slope.</p>
