        <h4 >Holt-Winters Linear Method</h4>
        <p>This method is identical to the exponential smoothing with a trend method. There are different ways that the JustEnough forecasting engine processes these two methods, but they will likely yield the exact same results. </p>
        <p>The Holt-Winters methodology is actually used in both exponential smoothing with a trend as well as exponential smoothing with a trend and seasonality. It is further utilized in the Holt-Winters additive trend additive seasonality method and the Holt-Winters multiplicative seasonality method.</p>
