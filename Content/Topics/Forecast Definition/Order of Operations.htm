        <h1>Order of Operations</h1>
        <p>The Forecast Definition is bound within a specific and linear order of operations, the understanding of which is necessary to any successful analysis of a particular forecast.</p>
        <p>The order of operations for a forecast definition is a linear process which contains 11 individual steps. Some steps may be left blank if it is determined that they are not relevant to a specific forecast. They are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-Survey</li>
            <li>Pre-Rule (a series rule)</li>
            <li>Pre-Processor</li>
            <li>Mid-Pre-Rule (a series rule)</li>
            <li>Backtrack</li>
            <li>Simulation</li>
            <li>Forecast</li>
            <li>Mid-Post-Rule (a series rule)</li>
            <li>Post-Processor</li>
            <li>Post-Rule (a series rule)</li>
            <li>Post-Survey</li>
        </ol>
        <p>“Pre” and “Post” in this instance refer to the Backtrack-Simulation-Forecast steps, which generate the actual forecast.</p>
