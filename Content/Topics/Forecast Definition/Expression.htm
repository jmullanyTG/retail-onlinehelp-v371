        <h3 >Expression</h3>
        <p>After selecting the parameters (or if you just want to see the default parameters) the actual mathematical expression that the engine will use will show up on the expression window. Users can edit the expression to make the survey more restrictive or more lenient, or they can use this window to write their own expressions. The “Test Expression” button will let you know if you have made an error in your expression authorship.</p>
