        <h4 >Holt-Winters Additive Trend Additive Seasonality</h4>
        <p>The Holt-Winters additive trend additive seasonality method is very similar to the exponential smoothing with a trend and seasonality method with the distinct difference that the seasonal indices are now added and subtracted instead of taking products and ratios. This method will still require the input of α, β, and γ smoothing factors as well as a separate seasonality parameter, which will be a value indicating the number of periods in a season.</p>
