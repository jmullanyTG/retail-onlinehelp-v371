        <h3 >Post-Processor</h3>
        <p>The post-processor is the required paring of the pre-processor. Any data tampering done during the pre-processor will be undone in this step, adding back realistic trends or seasonality to the forecast. The processor pair can be thought of as a “do/undo” set of rules; anything done to the data set via the pre-processor will always be undone at the time of the post-processor application. A post-processor rule will always have a matching pre-processor rule.</p>
