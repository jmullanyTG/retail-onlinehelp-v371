        <h3 >Simulation</h3>
        <p>Simulation will run concurrently in the order of operations with backtrack and is effected by the same prerequisites in the order of operations. Simulation is very similar to backtrack with the discernible difference that simulation will not self-correct. Any errors with the forecast will therefore compound. Simulation can be described as pessimistic (worst case) of the forecast.</p>
