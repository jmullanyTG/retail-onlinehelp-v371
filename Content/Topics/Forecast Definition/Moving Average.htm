        <h4 >Moving Average</h4>
        <p style="color: #000000;">One way to modify the influence of past data on the mean-as-a-forecast is to specify at the outset just how many past observations will be included in the mean. The term “moving average” is used to describe this procedure because as each new observation becomes available, a new average can be computed by dropping the oldest observation and including the newest one.</p>
        <p>When the moving average method is applied, the forecasting engine will look back a specific number of periods, find the mean of those periods and then forecast a straight, flat line at that value for all future points. The number of points the engine observes is the period of the moving average.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Example: For the series of data points 7, 4, 10 where they those numbers represent historical sales, a three point moving average (the period is three, so it looks at the last three points), the moving average would be 7 (the mean). When the sales figures for the next month come in and they show sales of 9 units, then the moving average would take the data points of 4, 10, 9 into account and present a new forecast of 7.66.</p>
