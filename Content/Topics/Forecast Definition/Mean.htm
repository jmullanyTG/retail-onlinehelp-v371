        <h4 >Mean</h4>
        <p>The simplest of averaging methods, the mean takes the average of all observed data as the forecast. The mean is almost never used as a forecasting method within the JustEnough forecasting engine. In fact, it is not listed as a separate method and would have to be applied as a version of the moving average with an infinite number of periods.</p>
