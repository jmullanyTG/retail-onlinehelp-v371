        <h4 >Exponential Smoothing</h4>
        <p>This is a dynamic weighted moving averages that calculates the next forecasted point by performing a weighted average on the previous points, where the weights are exponentially decreasing determined by a smoothing factor α. For this, α must be an input parameter. Adjusting α to a value closer to 1 will tell the forecasting engine that you have more confidence in your recent data points and to give a higher consideration to them when calculating your forecast.</p>
