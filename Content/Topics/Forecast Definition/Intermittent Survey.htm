        <h4 >Intermittent Survey</h4>
        <p>This survey rule will fail an intermittent method if there are not enough zero points. Itâ€™s measured by adding the HistoryZerosBetweenSales to the HistoryTrailingZeros and seeing if it is greater than 0.6 x the Seasonality. This will easily fail most intermittent methods for non-intermittent data.</p>
