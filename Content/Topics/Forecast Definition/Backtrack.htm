        <h3 >Backtrack</h3>
        <p>Backtrack (backcast) is the first step taken once the preliminary definitions have been established. Backtrack is a process by which the engine applies its forecasting method to a point earlier in the series. Backtrack will be optimistic (best case) of the forecast. Backtrack will look to the historical series, apply a forecast and then comparisons can be made to the actual data points further along in the series. Backtrack will self-correct as to better align with the known historical data points.</p>
