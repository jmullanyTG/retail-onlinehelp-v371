        <h3 >Pre-Rule</h3>
        <p>The pre-rule is the first of two potential series rules which happen before the forecast. The importance of the pre-rule is that it takes place before the pre-processor so the potential removal of any trends or seasonality has not yet taken place. It is an opportunity then to dampen trends or remove outliers before the processor takes any actions.</p>
