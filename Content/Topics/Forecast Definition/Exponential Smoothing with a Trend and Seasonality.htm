        <h4 >Exponential Smoothing with a Trend and Seasonality</h4>
        <p>This method builds upon the exponential smoothing with a trend and adds a third seasonality factor, γ. The smoothing of the seasonality is accomplished by the application of the γ seasonality factor, which will also be a value between 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>Adjusting γ to a value closer to 1 will tell the forecasting engine that you have more confidence in your recent data points and to give a higher consideration to them when calculating your forecast.</p>
