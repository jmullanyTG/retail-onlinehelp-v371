        <h3 >Sporadic</h3>
        <p>The sporadic processor rule will only be applicable to data sets with intermittent sales data that would use a predictive method such as croston intermittent demand. The sporadic processor would average the number of data points between zeros, add in (and later remove in the post-processor stage!) false data in order to allow the engine to forecast a smooth line.</p>
