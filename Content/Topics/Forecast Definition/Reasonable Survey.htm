        <h4 >Reasonable Survey</h4>
        <p>This is a very important survey rule. The reasonable survey will fail a method if the results are determined to be beyond the realm of realistic possibilities. This survey should almost always be included in the post-survey for all forecasting methods. If it is not included (or the parameters are changed in the expression) it should only be done if users intend to see what the forecasting engine can do when it doesnâ€™t need to return a reasonable result. The reasonable survey looks at the history to gather ForecastSeasonPercent</p>
