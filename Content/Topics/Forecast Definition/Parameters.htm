        <h3 >Parameters</h3>
        <p>Most of the pre-loaded survey rules will have a few included parameters. They can be seen by clicking on the “Manage Surveys” button, and then then double clicking on the survey name. The included parameters will be displayed in a window on the right side, above a list of any potential parameters that may be included in order to customize a survey, or in the creation of a unique survey. A description of the parameter can be viewed by hovering over the parameter name.</p>
        <p>Detailed descriptions of the included parameters are built into the tooltip function within JustEnough. As such, they may be viewed by “hovering over” the parameter with the mouse cursor.</p>
