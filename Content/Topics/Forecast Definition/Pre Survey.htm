        <h3 >Pre-Survey</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the pre-survey is to disqualify a method as quickly as possible. The pre-survey will determine whether or not a method should be run by examining the data points and seeing if they conform to some simple rules. An example would be the application of the linear regression survey to a data set in order to disqualify the simple linear regression with a trend and seasonality method from the tournament if the data shows no indication of linear regression. An additional example would be the application of the too intermittent survey to disqualify a number of methods if the data is simply too intermittent to correctly generate a forecast.</p>
