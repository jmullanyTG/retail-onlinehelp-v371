        <p>Processors can be thought of as a “do” and “undo” adjustment to the series so that the other mechanisms can function properly. They will always come in a pair. The can be used to ignore data, or trends in data, then add it back to provide a more accurate forecast. An example of a processor would be to ignore seasonality for a long term forecast, then run the method to generate an accurate curve, and finally, re-add the seasonality.</p>
