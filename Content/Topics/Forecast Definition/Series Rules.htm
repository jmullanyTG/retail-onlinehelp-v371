        <h1 class="Heading1">Series Rules</h1>
        <p>A series rule is used to modify the entire series of data points (i.e. the whole data set). This constitutes a permanent change to the series. This can be used to account for things like the addition of safety stock (raising the minimum level of the series) or predicting a drop off or 10% for all future points.</p>
