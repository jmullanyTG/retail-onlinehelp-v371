        <h1 class="Heading1">Forecast Definition Overview</h1>
        <p>The forecast definition module within JustEnough holds the rules by which the forecasting tool operates. As such, it is the backbone of the Forecasting Module. There are five major components which define a specific forecasting method: the base, any processors, any surveys, series rules and step rules. Some or all of these may be manipulated to define a forecasting method. The JustEnough forecasting engine follows a structured order of operations which is essential to understand in order to properly manipulate the engine and return a practical result. As manipulating the forecast definitions can cause a significant disruption if done improperly, it is highly recommended to restrict access to this module to JustEnough consultants and end users with both a strong background in statistical forecasting and administrative level rights. </p>
        <p>The forecasting engine runs a “tournament” to determine the best result and will display that result along with any other methods which did not fail. </p>
