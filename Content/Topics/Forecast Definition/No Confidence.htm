        <h3 >No Confidence</h3>
        <p>The no confidence processor rule is unique in that it does not follow many of the other restrictions placed on processor rules. The no confidence rule will, in essence, take a complete copy of the historical series on a seasonal level, and apply it to future periods based on the underlying forecasting method. </p>
        <p>There are no default parameters for this rule. </p>
