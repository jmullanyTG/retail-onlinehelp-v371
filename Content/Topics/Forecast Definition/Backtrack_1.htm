        <h4 >Backtrack</h4>
        <p>Backtrack (backcast) is the first step taken once the preliminary definitions have been established. Backtrack is a process by which the engine applies its forecasting method to a point earlier in the series. Backtrack will be optimistic (best case) of the forecast. Backtrack will look to the historical series, apply a forecast and then comparisons can be made to the actual data points further along in the series. Backtrack will self-correct as to better align with the known historical data points.</p>
        <h5 >Example</h5>
        <p>Forecasting beyond the current month (November) backtrack will look at a data point ten months ago (January) and then see how accurately the forecast would have predicted the known data point five months later (June).</p>
