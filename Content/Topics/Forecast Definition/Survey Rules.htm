        <p>Survey rules are yes or no questions that are applied to the forecast in order to determine its viability. These are a very simple way to fail a forecasting method that would likely yield an impractical result. The result of a series rule will be true or false. An example of a series rule would be to check if there are enough data points to fill in the specified number of periods for a moving average to be run. If you asked for three data points and there are only two, then the series rule will fail the method.</p>
