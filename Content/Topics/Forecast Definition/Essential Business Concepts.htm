        <p>Modes and methods together will define the forecast base. It is sometimes referred to simply as “forecast method”, but ignoring the mode misses a large part of how a forecast is generated for a particular series. There are three different types of modes used in JustEnough, two for quantitative methods and one for the na<span style="color: #000000;">ïve approach.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">The classification of forecasting methods can be broken down into two distinct groupings. The group called</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: #000000;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">averaging methods</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: #000000;">&#160;</span><span style="color: #000000;">conform to the conventional understanding of what an average is – namely, equally weighted observations. The second group of methods applies an unequal set of weights to past data and because the weights typically decay in an exponential manner from the most recent to the most distant data point, the methods are known as</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: #000000;">&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">exponential smoothing</span><span class="apple-converted-space" style="color: #000000;">&#160;</span><span style="color: #000000;">methods. JustEnough utilizes these two types of forecasting methods in addition to linear regression and intermittent demand. </span>
