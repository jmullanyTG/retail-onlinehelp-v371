        <h3 >Mid-Pre-Rule</h3>
        <p>The mid-pre-rule is an additional series rule, similar in every way to the pre-rule, but with a distinct difference that its place in the order of operations places it after the pre-processor. Having removed any potential seasonality or trends, the application of the mid-pre-rule at this point is important in that it is the last opportunity to modify the data series before the forecast.</p>
