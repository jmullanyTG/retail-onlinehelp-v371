            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Order Documents and Receipt Dates – </span>to meet the requirements of the majority of specialty retailers, functionality for the determination of size and prepack breakdowns for orders. Due to the inherent inaccuracies associated with doing these analyses for multiple receipt dates simultaneously, order manager documents can only be created with a single receipt date each. Unlimited order lines, including different variants and store cluster orders, can be included as long as they all share a single receipt date. This constraint also facilitates the tracking of outstanding activities for orders through the Upcoming Commitments Dashboard in Assortment Planning (see <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assortment Planning Dashboard – Assortment Upcoming Commitments Dashboard</span> section above)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Order Workflow – </span>Order Manager has been integrated with the JustEnough Workflow module to facilitate identification of and movement through the various stages of the ordering process, as defined by the needs of your organization. Multiple workflows, ranging from very simple expedited flows, where all stages are completed at once with a single submission of the order, to very complex, with several levels of approval at each stage and submissions to external systems after each, can be configured and used within Order Manager. The # of days out from the receipt date that each stage must be completed is configured in the Workflow module and then compared to the current date in the above referenced Upcoming Commitments Dashboard, allowing users to track their progress against established deliverables (for more information, please see the <span style="font-weight: bold;">JustEnough Workflow Manager Standard Documentation</span>)</li>
        </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Document Status vs Workflow Status – </span>there are two types of status within Order Manager – document status and workflow status. Document status describes the current ownership or state of the order document as a whole. Document statuses include things like Forwarded, Authorized, and Uploaded, and cannot be changed without customization. Workflow status, on the other hand, describes the stage of the active workflow that the order document is currently in. Workflow statuses are configurable through the Workflow module and can include anything your organization deems important. Available workflow statuses are dependent on the workflow currently assigned to an order document</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;font-weight: normal;"><b>Future Recommended Order Horizons</b> <b>–</b><![CDATA[  ]]><span style="font-weight: normal;">When generating future recommended orders, JustEnough extends the horizon specified in the “Days From Today” field to ensure that the order being placed has sufficient quantities to meet any inventory needs that may arise just beyond the order window provided by the user. This is especially critical for orders generated with “short” windows, such within 90 days.</span></li>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">The extended order horizon is calculated automatically by JustEnough based on the system policy <b>Future Inventory Window,</b> which has a default value of 14 days. The calculation used to determine the effective horizon is (Days From Today value + supply chain lead time + Future Inventory Window value). </span>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;">For supplier orders, the supply chain lead time is the max of the sum of lead times from the supplier all the way to the store. This is only done along the primary source path.</p>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Note</b>: This extended horizon is only used for future recommended orders for “Orders Placed”. It is not used for future recommended orders for "Orders Delivered". </p>
