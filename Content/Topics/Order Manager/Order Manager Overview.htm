        <h1>Order Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>Order Manager allows users to create and manage order information before it leaves JustEnough. Normal supplier orders, direct supplier drop-ship orders, transfers, allocations, commitments, and distributions may all be controlled in a document-centric format while following workflow rules established to conform to the business requirements.</p>
        <h2>Order Manager documents</h2>
        <p>Different Order Manager documents will be available based on enabled modules within JustEnough. As these document types are related to different processes, their fields and associated views are likely to differ. Order documents are organized with a header and several lines. The contents of the header will vary based on the order document type, but will typically include information such as ownership, security rights, workflow details, and narrative status.</p>
        <h2>Navigation and workflow</h2>
        <p>Once created, Order Manager documents may be viewed and updated (based on header state) through the navigation pane. Depending on the available permissions, users are able to view or edit documents in varying states of approval, or advance the document through the pre-defined workflow steps.</p>
        <h2>Automated&#160;order document generation</h2>
        <p>In addition to generating order documents manually in Order Manager, you can create <a href="../Job Manager/Inventory Order Document Generation Task.htm">tasks</a> in JustEnough's Job Manager to generate order documents automatically on a nightly, weekly, or otherwise-scheduled basis. </p>
