        <h1 >Creating Commitment Orders </h1>
        <p>Commitment orders can be created within Assortment Planning by using the Create Commitments button within the Receipt Plan supporting view (see <span style="font-weight: bold;">Line Visualization &gt; Supporting Views &gt; Receipt Plan View</span> for details), but doing so only allows you to create orders for one placeholder or collection at a time. While this may be perfectly fine in many cases, Order Manager gives you the ability to create commitment orders from assortment plans for entire sections of the product and site hierarchies and windows of time at once. To initiate the creation of new commitment orders in Order Manager, simply click the Commitment button in the top toolbar:</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Order Manager/Creating Commitment Orders.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 49px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Doing so will launch the Add Assortment Plan Order dialog</p>
