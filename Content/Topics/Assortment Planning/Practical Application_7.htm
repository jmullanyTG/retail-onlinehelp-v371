        <p style="text-align: justify;">Once the values have populated, users can use this report to slice and dice their assortment in reviewing choice counts for a defined time period in aggregate.&#160; This view can be utilized to pass key information to users that do not have access to the system.&#160; For example, merchandise planners can export this report to a PDF or Excel to share with merchants or buyers or visual merchandisers.&#160; </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, this report is intended to provide insight to how an assortment is planned and how balanced an assortment looks in comparing regular price, promotional and markdown choices into the assortment. For example, a denim planner can illustrate the balance of fit types planned in aggregate for a period and how many of each fit type are planned to be regular price, on promotion or on markdown.&#160; </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Similar to the Assortment Choice Count By Period report, this report makes it easy to draw comparisons to last year in total sales, COGS, margin, or productivity, though in aggregate rather than across time. The primary benefit of this report is that it also allows you to subdivide your business at any level by segments that live beneath and see the percent to total of each. For example, a tees planner might want to see what percent to total of sales different types of graphics represented to graphic tees as a whole. These insights may invoke discussion in the organization as to what the trends of the business are and if the trends are covered in reviewing future period plans.</p>
