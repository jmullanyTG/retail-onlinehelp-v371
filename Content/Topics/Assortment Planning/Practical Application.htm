        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Plan creation is the foundation of everything else you will do in Assortment Planning, so it is vital that sufficient time is given to discuss the points presented at the beginning of this section as well as to the pre-requisite steps outlined thereafter. Additionally, by taking the time to consider and set plan defaults that are appropriate to your business, you will streamline your workflow and save yourself a great deal of time as you plan. Consider the following points:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Attributes: </span><span style="color: #000000;">one of the strengths of the JustEnough Assortment Planning solution is that users have the ability</span><span style="color: #000000;"> define business segments that are not directly tied to your product hierarchy. Spending time to strategize among your team and define what attributes are meaningful and then structuring your plan accordingly is a great way to uncover and address areas of opportunity with your plans</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Cluster Sets: </span><span style="color: #000000;">cluster sets are the cornerstone of Assortment Planning in JustEnough. Carefully consider the areas of your business that you want to plan different assortments for and/or those that will be managed by different individuals and create your cluster sets accordingly</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Price Translations: </span><span style="color: #000000;">for companies doing business internationally, there may be additional costs associated that can decrease your profit margin â€“ import/export fees, tariffs, higher real estate prices, etc. JustEnough offers price translations as a way of simply creating premium pricing by </span><span style="color: #000000;">product hierarchy level, price range, and locale to help recoup those extra costs, if this is part of your corporate pricing strategy</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Plan Defaults:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> JustEnough Assortment Planning offers a wide array of defaults covering everything from cluster sets, seasonality, and size curves, to constraints such as periods of supply and pack tolerance % that are utilized as part of receipt planning and prepack optimization calculations. These can always be overridden later if needed, but taking the time to set defaults to cover the majority of cases will save you a great deal of time later</span>
