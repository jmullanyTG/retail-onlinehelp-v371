            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Promotions vs. Promotion Applications – </span>think of Defined Promotions as templates that can be used over and over. They don’t have ties to specific products or areas of your site hierarchy. At their core, they are a promotional index and an AUR effect that can be applied to different areas of your business, rather than having to create a separate promotion every time you want to take 30% off a different group of products. Promotion Applications are the actual product, site level, and time specific incarnation of Defined Promotions; as such, a single Defined Promotion can have infinite Promotion Applications.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Promotions and AUR – </span>because assortment plans are done at the placeholder/collection level, as opposed to aggregate levels used in merchandise financial plans, the decision was made to not allow direct editing of AUR and, rather, have it be a function of ticket price (AUT) and any promotions in effect. Because promotion participation can be managed at a site level, the system calculates a blended AUR based on each site’s % contribution to the cluster it is assigned to for a given period.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overlapping Promotions – </span>it is possible to have multiple promotions with different AUR effects and Promotional Indices active for the same products and clusters at the same time. How these promotions interact with each other is defined by their Stacking Behaviors. More specific information on these behaviors is available under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Defined Promotions Section &gt; Behavior</span> below, but basically, users have the option of choosing whether promotions active during the same period will combine to produce greater promotional effects, be used instead of other promotions present based on best-deal logic, or supersede other active promotions altogether</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Promotional Indices –</span> while, in very basic scenarios, the Final Index specified for a promotion will be what appears for the relevant periods in the Promotion Index field of Sales Plan view for a given placeholder/cluster, users should be aware that the actual Promotion Index shown may differ from this due to site level exclusions and Stacking Behaviors, when multiple promotions are present</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supplemental Info on Promotion Applications - </span>there is a supplemental Microsoft Excel model on the calculation of AUR, VAT, and Promotional Indices available to JustEnough consultants, which details the specific calculations used when promotions are applied</li>
