        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The main intent of this report is to drive the plan review process in an iterative tops-down (MFP) and bottoms-up (AP) planning structure.&#160; The general idea in Pre-season and In-Season planning is to ensure that the Assortment plan is aggressive enough to achieve the targets set within Merchandise Financial planning. This can be done by:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify;">Evaluating whether or not enough demand is planned to achieve the sales targets set in MFP, additionally reviewing the inventory planned to support the demand</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify;">Reviewing the flow cadence of intake set up with the assortment plans regarding receipts and whether or not the cadence of deliveries is in line with the desired intake targets set in Merchandise Financial Planning</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify;">Comparing the active assortment plan to any assortment plan snapshot that has been deemed important to an organization; for example, as a good hindsight activity, users could compare an original plan snapshot of the assortment plan to the active assortment plan at the end of the season to draw conclusions on the commitment process and whether or not the original plan the organization is buying to is accurate versus how the season is actually performing</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">These activities may help to generate discussions around commitment strategies and shortening lead times in certain areas of the organization.&#160; </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #FF0000;">Important:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">levels of commonality must exist for the foundational metrics to make sense in this view</span></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">In general, this report is a standard pivot grid set up, with standard JustEnough functionality contained in the view, such as creating and saving layouts, graphing metrics, and pivoting the time dimension within the grid.&#160; The one exception is that the parameters drive the product and site hierarchy selections, and pivoting of those dimensions is not possible. To move up or down common levels of the product and site hierarchies between two plans, the user must reselect the desired level of product and site in the parameters section of the view and hit execute for the data to refresh to the desired levels.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
