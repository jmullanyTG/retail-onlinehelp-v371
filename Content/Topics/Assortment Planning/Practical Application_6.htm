        <p style="text-align: justify;">Once the values have populated, users can use this report to slice and dice their assortment in reviewing choice counts for a defined time period.&#160; This view can be utilized to pass key information to users that do not have access to the system.&#160; For example, merchandise planners can export this report to a PDF or Excel to share with merchants, buyers or visual merchandisers.&#160; </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, this report is intended to provide insight to how an assortment is planned and how balanced an assortment looks in comparing regular price, promotional and markdown choices into the assortment over time. For example, a denim planner can illustrate the balance of fit types planned for a period and how many of each fit type are planned to be regular price, on promotion, or on markdown.&#160; </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This report makes it very easy to draw comparisons to last year in total sales, COGS, margin, or productivity. By using the Graph functionality with this report, users can easily see movement in all choice types as a season progresses to see if they remain in line with overall strategies for the business. These insights may invoke discussion in the organization as to what the trends of the business are and if the trends are covered in reviewing future period plans.</p>
