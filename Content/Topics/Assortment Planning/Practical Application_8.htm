        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p>The Assortment Upcoming Commitments Report is ESSENTIAL to keeping track of created commitment orders and ensuring that the activities required to provide sufficient information to suppliers are completed on-time, thus ensuring on-time delivery of products. Efficient use of this report merely involves setting the Window of Time to include a periods from the current week to a number of weeks out based on how long ordering activities such as Break By Size and Prepack analysis normally take. If managerial approvals are required in your organization, prior to submitting orders, the Window of Time selected should be increased to include the amount of time anticipated for review and any required changes.</p>
