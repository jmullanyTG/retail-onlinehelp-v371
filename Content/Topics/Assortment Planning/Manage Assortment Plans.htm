        <h1 class="Heading1">Manage Assortment Plans</h1>
        <p style="color: #000000;">Along with the prerequisite steps listed above, the parameters you select during plan creation are the cornerstones of success in the assortment planning process. Business process discussions should be had prior to plan creation to understand the existing infrastructure into which plans will be integrated. If Merchandise Financial Planning and/or Allocations systems or processes are in place, assortment plans should be structured to facilitate the movement of data between them. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 38pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">How is our business structured in terms of product? How many major categories are there and what subdivisions exist in each? What level of detail do we need inherent in our product hierarchy?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">How is our business structured in terms of selling channels? Do you need to segment by full and off-priced business, by country, by geography, some combination of all? Are there other factors related to site attributes (capacity, climate, demographic, etc.) that we use to group sites together?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is the structure of our</span><span style="color: #000000;"> financial reporting periods structured and what calendar is used to track them?</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">What will be our primary planning currency for financial targets and comparisons? Are there additional taxes or costs of doing business internationally to consider?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">What are the primary metrics and/or attributes against which our business will be measured?</li>
        </ul>
