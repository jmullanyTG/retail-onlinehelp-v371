        <p>Because of the flexibility JustEnough Assortment Planning offers in modeling infinite scenarios on which to base your plans, understanding how to user Scenario Manager to your advantage can go a long way toward helping you keep track of everything you’ve created and ultimately choose the right scenario to serve as a solid planning foundation. Here are some helpful tips to get you started:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Segments Effectively</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">: </span>one of the main differentiators between the JustEnough Assortment Planning solution and others available in the market is the flexibility it offers to segment business via methods other than standard product hierarchy levels. Segments can be modeled after any of the vast number of criteria available through product filters, but with this flexibility, it’s possible to do things that might be interesting but not necessarily beneficial to the planning process. <span style="font-weight: bold;">One of the best uses of segmentation is to discover opportunities that may be buried within the lowest levels of the assigned product hierarchy</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example: </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 111pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-style: italic;">L</span><span style="font-style: italic;">et’s say I’m a Mens Tees planner and the lowest level of my product hierarchy is short-sleeved graphic tees. I could just Segment By Hierarchy, split my business by cluster and proceed with my plan, but what if I have a few distinct types of short-sleeve graphic tees that aren’t separated in my hierarchy? I might use product attributes to define the segments Comic, Humor, Allover Print, and Repeat Print to dig deeper into the business. </span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After calculating my scenario, I discover that Comic tees represented 55% of my total sales</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> with a 90% Comparison % Active Choices, but had the fewest number of customer choices offered for the window of time being analyzed. This suggests that a greater number of choices should be offered in this segment for the coming season, and because I have segmented in this way, the system will automatically allocate 55% of my target sales to Comic tees and recommend the optimal number of choices to support that volume</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. Had I not segmented in this manner, I would only have target sales volume and recommended choices for total short-sleeve graphic tees and would likely have missed this trend.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example:</span> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 111pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;font-style: italic;">Now, let’s say I’m a Mens Tops planner, and beneath Mens Tops exist Tees, Wovens, Knits, and Sweaters, all of which are levels that exist in the assigned hierarchy. I choose to create manual segments by Color Family to analyze colors that are trending in my area. While this is great to do for an analysis, I may want to reconsider using this scenario to Smart Start.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The reason is, because my segments are defined in a way that will likely cross over multiple product categories, while I will gain an understanding of where opportunities might exist by color, I won’t have insight into the specific varieties of tops that those colors should be focused in, nor will I see if certain varieties of tops actually did poorly in colors that are trending well overall.</span> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modeling New Business Areas</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">: </span>Target Creation provides two methods to project anticipated sales volume and/or choice count needs for new areas of business:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Model via Target Filter: </span>in this method, simply create a segment for your new area of business and name appropriately, but when selecting a Target Filter, select one for an area of business that you believe most closely mirrors your expected sales. This is sometimes referred to as the “pattern after” approach. If you aren’t certain which business area or filter you should use, calculate your scenario for all the existing business segments first, review the results, and choose the Target Filter for the segment that looks best.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 111pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">If you don’t want to use the entire volume of a chosen Target Filter, the sales volume can always be adjusted directly or via the Target Percent Contribution metric in Segment Cluster Details</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #F79646;">Warning:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Be aware that using this method will double-count sales volume for the items in the Target Filter you choose for your new business area. Depending on whether you anticipate actual sales growth in the scenario product hierarchy selection or just a shift of sales from existing business segments to the new one, you may need to adjust your planned segment Target Percent Contribution values accordingly.</span> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Model via Supplemental Filter: </span>if you don’t want to double-state sales for a given business segment in order to model sales for your new area of business, you can select a Supplemental Filter for your segment as a means of providing sales history <span style="font-weight: bold;">that is only used during Rationalization to calculate recommended choice counts</span>. In this method, your new business segment will still calculate historical volume based on the Target Filter, if any, that you selected for it – most likely this will be all zeros for new business areas – but once you define the a Target Percent Contribution and/or TY Act New Sales for it, Rationalization will use the data specified in the Supplemental Filter to calculate the Marginal Return Curve Matrix and determine the recommended choice counts based on the defined sales volume.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 111pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">this method is ideal when </span><span style="font-style: italic;">you </span><span style="font-style: italic;">want to plan as a percentage increase </span><span style="font-style: italic;">over your existing areas of business</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Because Target Percent Contribution does not have to equal 100% for the total of all segments, you can simply set your new business area to a percentage of the Scenario Target, and Rationalize the scenario normally.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: square;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #F79646;">Warning:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">you must define sales volume for your new area of business prior to Rationalization or your recommended choice counts will calculate to zero</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comparison Total vs. Active Choices:</span> the goal of showing the user Total versus Active choices for historical data is to bring to light areas of the business that were potentially over or under-assorted for the window of time being analyzed. Here are some things to watch for:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Choice counts that are much lower than Total Choice counts </span>– this is generally accompanied by a high Comparison % Active Choice Sales and indicates that a majority of the sales volume could likely have been achieved with an assortment that was narrower and deeper. When customers are given too many choices, sales tend to be split among similar choices, making for mediocre performance of each and more liable inventory left at the end of the season.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Choice counts that are very near or equal to the Total Choice counts</span> – this will be accompanied by a high Comparison % Active Choices and may indicate the need for more breadth of assortment in this segment. Generally speaking, a small percentage of choices offered account for a majority of sales, so if this is the case, your customers may be wanting more assortment in this area and you may have missed sales due to lack of a larger assortment.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Choice counts that are much lower or higher than expected </span>– while it’s possible you may have just had very poor or very good sellers in the window of time you selected, it’s possible that your data cleansing parameters are too stringent or loose for the areas of business you’re analyzing. Try adjusting the parameters described in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rationalization</span>, above, and recalculating the scenario.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Choice sales are greater than Total Choice sales </span>– because returns register as negative sales, if returns represent a large enough portion of your business, it is possible for this scenario to occur. This is because the data cleansing that occurs prior to calculating Active Choice sales removes the negative sales values, thus increasing the overall sales magnitude.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">User Overrides: </span> one of the core tenets of design for JustEnough Assortment Planning was to give the user ultimate control over the outcome at every stage. For this reason, we’ve allowed user overrides for Scenario Target, Target Percent Contribution, TY Act New Sales &amp; Sales U, AUR, and Choices, but it should be noted that, once you begin deviating from the system calculated outputs for these fields, the system can only use the information you’ve provided it. The Scenario Target can be overridden and completely ignore the Plan Basis or historical sales volume that normally drives it, final choice counts can be set well beyond the counts recommended through Rationalization, and so on. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The best use of these edits is to fine tune rather than make broad changes</span>, but ultimately you have the ability to do either. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use the Clear function to reset to the system calculated values if you find you’ve gotten too far off track</span>.</li>
