        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 12pt;">Assortment plans typically contain granular data related to the item plans of an organization, as it represents the detail behind what items are being bought, when items deliver, and the lifecycle information for items related to Sales, Cost of Sales, Margin, Receipts, and Inventory ownership.&#160; This rich information can be leveraged within an organization to view plans at various aggregated levels of the product, location and time hierarchies.&#160; </p>
