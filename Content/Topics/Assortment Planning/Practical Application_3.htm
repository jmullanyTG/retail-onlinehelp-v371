        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Line Visualization offers users a wide array of options for crafting assortment plans: working by collections or placeholders, by cluster set and cluster, planning sales, receipts, and inventory adjustments by period, modeling rates of sale, seasonality and more. With all of this functionality so readily available, it can be easy to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">get lost along the way. That said, taking some time to consider the structure of your business and your objectives then crafting a logical process to facilitate them will help improve efficiency as you work. Here are some tips to help you get the most out of the system:</span>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Setting Up Layouts and Workspaces: </span>the JustEnough Assortment Planning interface allows users a great deal of flexibility in configuring screen layouts and workspaces. To maximize efficiency as you work, take some time to set up custom layouts and workspaces that are geared toward specific tasks. Some examples are:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cluster Assorting – </span>within Placeholder mode, it may be useful to create a workspace with the Style Bank and the Cluster Details panes docked, allowing you to see how many clusters a given placeholder is assorted to as you assign variants</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cluster &amp; Rate of Sale – </span>creating a workspace in either mode that includes the Rate of Sale Calculator docked at the bottom and Cluster Set View docked at the right will give you excellent visibility to how your plan changes as you apply rate of sale scenarios</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Seasonality or Promotions and Sales Plan (multi-screen) – </span>if you have a multi-monitor setup, docking the Seasonality Curve Generator at the bottom of screen one then breaking out and maximizing Sales Plan view on a second screen will allow you to see changes at both placeholder/collection level and by period for the selected item as you apply seasonality curves. In this configuration, you could also easily tab to Promotions view in the docked bottom pane and see changes to promo applications at a period level</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dual Screen Planning with Image View – </span>take advantage of a second monitor by breakdown out and maximizing Image view while your main screen remains dedicated to the Main Planning view. Watch your assortment visually change as you assign variants, change phase in and out dates, and assort them to clusters</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smart Starting vs. Manual Placeholder Creation</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">: </span>while it is completely fine to bypass Target Creation and start creating placeholders manually, doing so potentially sets you up for a good deal more work to get your plan going. Conversely, while Smart Starting a well-thought-out scenario can get you 90% of the way done in a very short time, it may not provide you with the precision you require in all cases. Consider the following example, in which a hybrid approach is used to good effect:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I’m a Men’s Tops pla</span><span style="font-style: italic;">nner and, in my short sleeve graphic tees business, I have several definable segments of my business that aren’t part of my product hierarchy – Humor, Comic, and Allover Print. I model a Target Creation scenario based on these three business segments, arrive at what seems to be a reasonable number of choices by cluster to achieve my financial targets for each area, but before I Smart Start, I realize something. Within Comic Tees, I have a few staple looks – a Batman logo tee and an Iron Man graphic print – that repeat every season with new styles that are slightly different. They always exhibit similar selling performance and I feel confident in modeling the new versions after the sales history of their predecessors.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I could just Smart Start the scenario and assign my new Batman and Iron Man tees to the placeholders that look the closest in </span><span style="font-style: italic;">performance. I could even model rates of sale for each in the Rate of Sale Calculator to more closely mirror last season’s trends, but that seems like a lot of extra work for 2 style-colors. Instead, I create two new placeholders in Line Visualization, selecting last season’s versions of the styles as the Like Styles and add a Mod Factor of 1.05 to each, to account for an anticipated 5% sales growth. I don’t have the new variants to assign yet, but I know they’re coming, so I assign the necessary values to the Comic Character Attribute Family via the Attributes side view and change both placeholders to Created status.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Next, I go back into my Target Creation scenario, Refresh my Target Filter for the Comic Tees segment, and Recalculate the scenario. The system recognizes the two placeholders I just created in Line Visualization and backs their sales volume out of my TY New Item Sales for that segment. I Rationalize again and see that my recommended choice counts have decreased to accommodate the new placeholders. NOW, I Smart Start the scenario. The system creates the remaining placeholders around those I created manually, giving me a solid foundation for the yet-unknown styles I will have in each segment</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, but my Batman and Iron Man tee placeholders that I crafted with more specific knowledge remain intact.</span>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collections vs. Placeholders: </span>if you’re in the soft goods business, chances are, you think about your assortment in terms of styles and style-colors – what we call collections and placeholders. If this is the case, working in Collection mode will probably suit you very well. Then again, perhaps your business model deals more with unique items that only come in a single color or maybe color has no bearing on your business at all, and Placeholder mode works better for you. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">If working with collections makes the most sense for you, it’s probably best to start in Collection view and define your sales plans at that level first then move down to Placeholder level once you feel comfortable with them. Changes made in Collection mode push down proportionately based on the percent contribution of the placeholders beneath, so you will have a solid tiering structure into which you can simply assign style colors when you’re ready and which can be easily adjusted by manipulating the Collection % Contribution of each.</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">Or, perhaps collections do have meaning to you, but you think more in terms of how individual style-colors rank in your overall assortment. If this is the case, maybe you will find it more useful to start in Placeholder mode, tier your assortment based on the strength of individual style-colors, then use Collection mode as more of a double-check for assortment breadth and continuity. The choice is yours, but the less bouncing between views you do, the more time you will save.</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">&#160;</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">While there is no restriction within Just Enough Assortment Planning that requires collections to only consist of multiple colors of the same style, that is the most common paradigm for their use.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Working with Clusters: </span>working with clusters in Assortment Planning is an essential part of the process to truly take advantage of the opportunity that may exist in different areas of your site hierarchy. Much of this can be realized through the Target Creation process, but regardless, at some point, you will likely want to fine tune your plans at the cluster level. If you think of Line Visualization as steps in a process, working in Cluster Set view most logically comes after you’re happy with your plans at the placeholder and collection levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">Though Line Visualization was designed with the idea of always allowing the user to maintain visibility to the overall plan, digging in to cluster level too early may cause a lot of back and forth making changes at different levels. Note that, while users do have access to Cluster Set view in Collection mode as well, this view should be used with caution as it means making changes across all placeholders in a collection but a single cluster set/cluster at a time. It may be difficult to work at this unique level before first working with the placeholders and clusters beneath it.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assorting in Cluster Details View: </span>Cluster Details view was designed to make it as quick and painless as possible to try different assorting scenarios of items among the clusters in your plan. To that end, simply check and uncheck placeholders/collections as you see fit in the cluster grid, Apply, and watch your plan metrics change accordingly. If you don’t like the outcome, the system saves the previous plan values of clusters you’ve un-assorted, making it easy to get back to where you were and try a different approach.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 39pt;">All of that said, what the system will not do is create sales plans from nothing for clusters that did not have them previously. You can absolutely expand placeholder/collections to clusters that they weren’t assigned to when they were generated, but doing so will require you to give those clusters a sales plan, whether by using the Rate of Sale Calculator or manually keying in ROS, Ttl Sls, or Ttl Buy, and then assigning a curve, either via the Seasonality Curve Generator or by choosing one manually from the in-line Seasonality Curve dropdown. Once these things are done, your expanded clusters will have sales plans and you can work with them in the grid normally.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">the system will not raise an error if you haven’t done these steps – you will simply have placeholders assorted to clusters but with no sales against them; also note that, if no seasonality curve is assigned, the system will assume a flat curve, assigning indices of 1.0 to all periods</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #7030A0;">Handling Variants Where Some Cluster Sets are Managed Via Replenishment and Some Aren’t: </span>This is a special case, but if your organization does happen to have different management requirements (or different suppliers, for that matter) for the same variant (actual item) across different cluster sets, this is for you. Rules written into Assortment Planning stipulate that you cannot have the same variant assigned to different placeholders that are assorted to overlapping cluster sets during the same time periods. That said, as long as the assorted cluster sets don’t overlap, you can assign the same variant to as many placeholders as you like. The following example shows how this can be achieved:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">let’s say you have a black V-neck t-shirt that you’ve been selling for over a year in your US stores, but now you want to offer it as a new item in your UK stores. You have plenty of sales history in the US stores to drive an effective replenishment forecast and manage your reordering needs, but you want to manage the ordering of the t-shirt for your UK stores more directly through Assortment Planning. You cannot simply assort the cluster set for your UK stores to the existing placeholder because placeholder Status (ie. Control via the Forecasts module) is set at the placeholder level – not at the cluster set level, so what do you do?</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">By creating a new placeholder, assorting it to only the UK cluster set, and then assigning the variant for the black V-neck t-shirt, you can manage the ordering of the item for your UK stores separately without having to change how stock for your US stores is managed. If you want to use the historical sales data from your US stores</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> to help forecast the needs for your UK stores, you can either use the Hindsight tool to create the new placeholder and assign the existing item as a Like Style, using a Mod Factor to adjust the results up or down if you like, or create the new placeholder separately then use the ROS Calculator to create a more finely tuned data scenario then apply the resultant ROS to the UK cluster set.</span>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sales Plan View</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> in Pre-Season Planning</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">: </span>Again, if we’re moving through Line Visualization as a process, the real benefit of Sales Plan view, pre-season, is in using it in tandem with the Seasonality Curve Generator supporting view and Promotions to fine tune changes to your sales plan by period after you’re happy with everything from collection down to cluster. Making changes at this level any sooner will quickly become overwhelming, and it’s important to understand, too, that <span style="font-weight: bold;">changes at this level may not even be required</span> for much of your plan. The following example shows a good use of this view pre-season:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">building on our example from earlier, let’s say I’m further into the planning process and am now applying a promotion to my Iron Man tee to capitalize on the release of a related movie midway through the season. </span><span style="font-style: italic;">I apply the promo and then go into Sales Plan view for the tee to </span><span style="font-style: italic;">check on the promotional effects over the application period and notice the sales spike much higher than I anticipated. </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After having a look at the </span><span style="font-style: italic;">seasonality curve, it </span><span style="font-style: italic;">appears to already have a significant lift during the same period. I go into the Curves module, examine the criteria on which the curve was built, and find that it included promotional sales and was based on a filter created to isolate Comic Tees – thus it appears I may be over-accounting for promotional sales with </span><span style="font-style: italic;">my newly applied promo, which i</span><span style="font-style: italic;">s based on </span><span style="font-style: italic;">very similar</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> data</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. I choose to apply a seasonality curve without promotional sales used in its calculation and let my applied promotion to stand, thereby adjusting the sales lift for the promotional period to more realistic levels.</span>
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Receipt Planning and Optimization: </span>in Receipt Plan view, users have the ability to specify a number of constraints that are directly tied to how much inventory needs to be carried at any given time to fulfill them – Minimum Presentation, Periods of Supply, Min Stk to Sales, and Shrink % of Sales. While all of these constraints can be set concurrently, it’s important to understand how they interact. Please note that the following example is for illustrative purposes only as it is not possible to fully recreate the logic of the Receipt Engine in a simple spreadsheet model.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">notice how the required units to fulfill Periods of Supply, Min Stk to Sales and Sales plus Min Pres and Shrink are calculated separately by period. The MAX of the constraint needs in each period defines the Ideal EOP each period should end on in order to satisfy all constraints for the period. </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The real crux of this example lies in the fact that the system can only suggest receipts in weeks 1 and 4. The placeholder is marked down in Wk 7, thereby releasing the engine from further fulfilling constraints, but notice in Wk 6, just prior to markdown, the Ideal EOP is driven by the Min Stk to Sales constraint, which requires </span><span style="font-style: italic;">6</span><span style="font-style: italic;">00 units for the period</span><span style="font-style: italic;">. Even though this leaves more units left at the end of Wk 8 than are technically necessary to fulfill sales and shrink, the system must bring in all the units required to fulfill the Wk 6 constraint in Wk 4 – the last available receipt date.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;font-style: italic;">That said, the term “optimization” with regard to Receipt Engine outputs means the system finds the optimal receipt strategy given the constraints specified by the user.</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Receipt Planning and Optimization: </span>in Receipt Plan view, users have the ability to specify a number of constraints that are directly tied to how much inventory needs to be carried at any given time to fulfill them – Minimum Presentation, Periods of Supply, Min Stk to Sales, and Shrink % of Sales.

Please note that the following example is for illustrative purposes only as it is not possible to fully recreate the logic of the Receipt Engine in a simple spreadsheet model.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Snapshots, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Actualization and In-Season Planning: </span>once you’re in-season and your assortment has begun selling, the system will read in and actualize sales and other metrics as each period closes. Though certain aspects of your plan will become locked for editing (see <span style="font-weight: bold;">Line Visualization &gt; Essential Business Concepts – Actualization</span> for details), you can still use all of the views within Line Visualization to respond to variances in your plan:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take Snapshots: </span>taking snapshots of your plan prior to the start of the season ensures that you’ll be able to maintain reference back to your originally planned values as sales begin to actualize (see <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manage Assortment Plans – Header Area Controls &gt; Snapshots </span>for more information)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes in the Main Planning View: </span>as you progress through the season, you may find you wish to want to make plan adjustments but keep the same basic tiering of placeholders in a collection, clusters assigned to a placeholder, or periods across an item’s life. You can still use the Main Planning view to affect these changes – <span style="color: #FF0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">you simply can’t make adjustments that would cause the total sales plan to drop beneath the value of sales that have already actualized</span></span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left: 75pt;">If you’ve made edits in Sales Plan view, remember that the system will not overwrite them with changes made in the Main Planning view. You can, however, use the Grand Total column in Sales Plan view to set your total sales to the desired level while still keeping the structure of your changes and each period’s percent contribution intact.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 75pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Balancing in Receipt Plan View: </span>a by-product of sales actualizing is that you’ll be able to track them against your receipt plan and use the Receipt Engine to help you get back on track. This is, of course, you have the ability to push/pull/cancel receipts or order more stock in time to accommodate the shifts in demand you’re seeing, but the system can, at least, assist in understanding what is required so you can speak to and prepare for any shortfall or excess that may occur.</li>
