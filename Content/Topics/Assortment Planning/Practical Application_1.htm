        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p>Because of the flexibility JustEnough Assortment Planning offers in modeling infinite scenarios on which to base your plans, understanding how to user Scenario Manager to your advantage can go a long way toward helping you keep track of everything you’ve created and ultimately choose the right scenario to serve as a solid planning foundation. Here are some helpful tips to get you started:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 39pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Column Sorting and Filtering: </span>being able to sort and filter by columns is standard JustEnough functionality throughout the suite, but it can come in handy here if you’re trying to narrow your selection from multiple scenarios. Custom filtering using the “Like” condition and wildcard characters (ex. Like - %Mens Tops%) or setting numeric ranges for Scenario Targets or New Choices make it easier to zero in on just a few.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-Select: </span>the Scenario Details section will show the segments of multiple scenarios stacked on top of each other, allowing for quick comparisons without having to use the full Compare functionality.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compare: </span>the compare functionality is very handy for analyzing two scenarios together. You can, for example, review the differences in basing your plan on custom segments based on product attributes like fabric type or color group versus a more traditional hierarchy based approach. Be aware, though, that any two scenarios can be compared as long as they are in at least Calculated status and comparing unequal data sets will be unlikely to yield much insight.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scenario Naming Validation:</span> in the event users name scenarios identically, not to worry – the system will validate against all saved scenarios and append the system Scenario ID onto duplicates, so you will never lose the ability to differentiate between them within the Target Creation Scenarios list.</li>
        </ul>
