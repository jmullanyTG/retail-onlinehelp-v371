        <h1 class="Heading1">Line Visualization</h1>
        <p>Line Visualization is where you will do the majority of your work in JustEnough Assortment Planning. Many other systems force users to navigate multiple screens or tabs to access different functionality, but this is generally done as a concession due to limited screen space rather than because it enhances user workflow. The JustEnough design breaks this tradition by, instead, providing access to core functionalities through expandable side and bottom pane views that can be quickly configured on one screen or multiple and then saved as workspaces for quick recall later. This allows users to always maintain visibility to the core of their plan, including product images and see the effect of changes at different levels of the plan as they are made.</p>
