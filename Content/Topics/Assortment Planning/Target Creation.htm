        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">Traditional Assortment Planning tools are typically rigid in the way users are allowed to plan:</span> by product and site hierarchy only. This has led to many retailers attempting to gain detail by further extending their hierarchies, but this approach still doesn’t offer true flexibility to adjust strategy as often as desired based on the changing needs of the business. JustEnough Assortment Planning offers users the ability to segment hierarchy levels by a wide array of product attributes, both qualitative and quantitative, and then further subdivide and define plan targets and desired new choice counts all the way down to a cluster level.</p>
