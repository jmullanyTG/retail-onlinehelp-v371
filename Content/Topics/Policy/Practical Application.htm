        <p>To reorder a task, users should highlight the specific task and click the up or down arrows on the right hand side. This will change the task execution order. Changes may also be made by editing the task execution order field (changes will reorder and normalize on save). </p>
        <p>Tasks may be executed outside of the daily job manager by clicking the “execute” button. This may be necessary if changes have been made to existing enabled policy tasks.</p>
