        <h1 >Order Policy Type</h1>
        <p>Order policy type will determine the status for the items within the filter and if they should be stocked, reordered or set to another specific type.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Normal Stocked – </span>The "normal stocked" order policy type will treat the item or items as a regular everyday selling item. It should be continually stocked and replenished when its ordering criteria are met. Normal stocked items are replenished using a fixed-period ordering methodology. This classification is best suited to items where demand is not intermittent (having periods of no demand interspersed with periods of low demand) and forecasting for future demand is reasonably achievable.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bin –</span> A bin item is best suited to items with intermittent, low demand. A fixed-quantity order methodology applies. <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;"><li>Example: Always ensuring that two items exist, and as soon as one is sold, another is ordered to bring the stock on hand back to the set bin level of two. </li></ul></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Stocked – </span>Making an item "non-stocked" means JustEnough will not make replenishment recommendations for the item except to address the following cases, and then only if the need cannot be met with current stock on hand: <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;"><li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Immediate demand</li><li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Customer orders</li><li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Safety stock unit requirements.</li></ul></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Redundant</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (discontinued)</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> –</span> Redundant items are items that are never likely to sell or be in demand and this specific classification prevents items from being reordered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users may also choose a “do not set” option for order policy type. This allows for non-order policy specific settings (i.e. order multiple) settings to be updated without otherwise disrupting the order policy driven behavior. </p>
