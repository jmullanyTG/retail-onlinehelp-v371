        <h1 >Model Stockholding</h1>
        <p class="BodyText">The purpose of setting policy is to create a model of ideal inventory holding against which to measure actual inventory holding, right down to item level. If the forecasted demand and the supplier delivery lead times were completely accurate, then the stockholding profile would look as follows with a model stock holding of SS + Â½RC:</p>

        </p>
        <p class="BodyText">From the graph, the safety stock is the minimum level to which you plan to drop the inventory level. At the point that the inventory level reaches the safety stock level, a new shipment arrives (the replenishment amount). For the next replenishment period, this replenishment amount is sold or issued from the store to the point at which the stock level again reaches the safety stock level (and the next replenishment amount arrives in the store.)  </p>

        <p class="BodyText">When inventory does not act ideally, the ideal inventory model can be used to quantify how far inventory is from ideal. Excess, shortfall and stock out values are used to do this.</p>
