        <p>All remaining policy settings relate to the replenishment strategy for the item or items contained within the filter. Replenishment is done at review period intervals. By considering whether inventory levels are expected to drop below the safety stock level within the next lead-time, replenishment values are recommended to restore inventory to its maximum level.</p>
        <p>The settings available within the policy section will be visible based on the selected order policy type; not all policy settings will be visible at one time. </p>
