        <p>Access to the policy pivot is controlled through a user access right. As there is the potential to affect critical values across large segments of an organization, it is highly recommended that only users with a full understanding of the consequences should be granted access to the feature. </p>
        <p>The parameters used to drive the information which will be used to populate the pivot grid will obey user assign filters. If items/locations are excluded from a userâ€™s assigned filters, but contained within the hierarchal segmentation or selected filter, the inventories will not appear in the pivot grid; their policy settings will not be changed. </p>
