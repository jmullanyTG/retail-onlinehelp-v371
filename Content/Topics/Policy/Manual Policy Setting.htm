        <h1 >Manual Policy Setting</h1>
        <p>When setting policy manually, it is possible for a user to set an item to a manual policy item so that the policy (review period, replenishment cycle, safety stock) does not get overwritten unintentionally by policy tasks. A user can use this screen to set all items to either manual (policy will not be overwritten in policy task), or auto.</p>
