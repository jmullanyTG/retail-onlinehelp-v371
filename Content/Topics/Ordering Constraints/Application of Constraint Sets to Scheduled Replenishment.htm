        <h1 >Application of Constraint Sets to Scheduled Replenishment Tasks</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Constraint sets require an order header as an application parameter as theyâ€™re designed to be a consciously applied user driven action within the replenishment/allocation process. This does not preclude constraint sets from being applied to task driven (i.e. overnight) runs. To execute a constraint set, order headers must be created as part of a post-engine process, then the constraint sets may be run through execution of <span style="font-family: Consolas;font-size: 10pt;">OrderManager</span><span style="font-family: Consolas;color: #808080;font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: Consolas;font-size: 10pt;">Order_Line_Inventory_Constrain </span>with the appropriate parameters. </p>
