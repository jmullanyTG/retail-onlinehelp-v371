        <h1 >Constraint Groups</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">Constraint groups may be used to selectively apply constraints to inventories within a given filter. Constraint groups are determined by the contents of the standard view <span style="font-family: Consolas;font-size: 10pt;">uvw_ConstraintGroupName</span>. Within this view, fields are available such as Type Code (order policy indicator), Priority and Criticality (from Inventory Classifications), Product Groups 1-20 (inventory groups), and site groups 1-2.</p>
