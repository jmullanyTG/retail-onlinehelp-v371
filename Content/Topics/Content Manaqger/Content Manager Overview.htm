        <p>Content Manager supports the management of product promotional Content (i.e. Copy Text and Images) for the marketing and advertising teams. All default advertising copy, disclaimers and special callouts can be managed within a centralized content repository which can then be customized at the Promotion and Event levels. The repository stores all content needed across all market channels, and depending on format, will utilize the appropriate fields for each advertising vehicle and channel. For added flexibility, the fields are customizable. </p>
        <p>Customized versions of the content can be created for different markets channels. This allows for greater control of the advertising messages delivered to consumers. Versions are typically based on language, localized interests by channel for automated versioning.</p>
        <p>Digital assets (i.e. Images) are managed from a centralized dashboard including product images, manufacturer logos and icons. The digital assets can be configured to display in different channels. The system supports thumbnails and low resolution images.</p>
