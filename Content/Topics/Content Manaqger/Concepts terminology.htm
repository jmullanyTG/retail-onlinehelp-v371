        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product</span> – Product is a general term to refer interchangeably to an Item Master, Variant, grouping of Item Masters, grouping of Variants, or a grouping of product groups. The applicable definition will vary based on the system configuration and the specific situation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product Group</span> – In this document, the term product group is used to specifically refer to a grouping of Item Masters, grouping of Variants or a grouping of product groups interchangeably. This term is used only when a single Item Master or single Variant type product is not applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Child Products</span> – Child products are the products contained within a product group.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content</span> – There are two types of Content stored for a product, Copy Text and Images. Content can be stored at three different levels:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Content</span> – A product’s Master Content is used to initialize Promotion Content and Event Content if using the Content Link functionality. Master Content is accessed via Content Manager.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Promotion Content</span> – A product’s Promotion Content is initialized from Master Content when a Promotion is created for it or if a Content Link exists. Promotion Content is accessed via the Promotions Manager solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Event Content</span> – Event Content is created when a Promotion is added to a Slot or if a Promotion is created for a Slot. Event Content is initialized from Promotion Content in the first case and from Master Content in the latter. The Promotion on the Event can also have a Content Link to either the Promotion or Master Content. Event Content is accessed via the Events Manager solution.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Content Version</span> – In addition to the different levels (i.e. Master, Promotion and Event) where Content can be stored for a product, there may also be more than one Content Version at each level. Content Versions allows you to specify variations in product Content due to language, geography or other advertising considerations. Each Content Version may also have its own set of custom fields.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master Content</span> – Master refers to the originating source of Content (i.e. Copy Text and Images) configured for each product. If Master Content was not configured, it can be manually entered or copied from Promotion Content level or Event Content level for the same product if you have the appropriate permissions. Master Content can only be accessed via Content Manager. </li>
        </ul>
