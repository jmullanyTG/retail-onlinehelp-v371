        <h1 class="Heading1">Dashboard Overview</h1>
        <p>The dashboard view will greet users upon signing into JustEnough, and as such, serves as the introduction to the flexibility and power contained within the application. The dashboard is, by design, highly configurable and is therefore likely to vary depending on the specific needs of the business, the individual user, or a specific role.</p>
