        <p>The details section of an item manager view will return much of the pertinent information from other sections of the application which relate to the inventories returned in the filter. The item-site combination which defines the inventory will be displayed at the top of the details section; the items in the filter may be viewed individually by highlighting them in the grid, or using the arrow keys on the right side. </p>
        <p>Each tab will list related information, some of which may be manipulated within the view. This gives users the ability to edit their inventory polices and properties at the most granular level. </p>
