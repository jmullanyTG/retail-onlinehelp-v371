        <p>The forecast viewer tab will display identical information to that which may be found in the Forecasts Module. Additional information may be found within the Forecasts Module help documentation. </p>
        <h2>Allocation vs Replenishment forecasts</h2>
        <p>The Forecast Viewer tab displays allocation- or replenishment-related forecast data depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the </p>
        <p>Demand&#160;Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite ("Replenishment", for short). </p>
        <p>If you have both the Allocations module <i>and</i> the Replenishment suite enabled in your instance of JustEnough, the <b>Allocation Strategy Selection</b> field in the <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Strategy_1.htm">Allocation Strategy</a> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. You can add the <b>Execution Process</b> column to your Item Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are "Allocations engine" or "Replenishment engine".</p>
