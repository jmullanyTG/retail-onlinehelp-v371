        <h1 >Inbound and Outbound Orders</h1>
        <p>The inbound and outbound orders tab will display all of the inbound and outbound orders which have been imported to JustEnough from the ERP system (or other system of record). It is important to remember that this is inventory specific, meaning that the orders displayed relate only to a single site. </p>
