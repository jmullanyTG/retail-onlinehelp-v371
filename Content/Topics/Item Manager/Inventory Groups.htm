        <h1 >Inventory Groups</h1>
        <p>Inventory groups will display group settings which have been configured for the inventory. As the inventory groups themselves are highly configurable, the information displayed here will vary from one implementation to another. Possibilities may include product hierarchy information, buyer groups, etc.</p>
        <p>Classification information such as the default priority assigned and the relative deviation will be displayed in this tab. </p>
