        <h1>Item Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>Item Manager is a powerful, yet flexible tool for monitoring and managing the inventory planning process at the inventory (item/location) level. It is a central hub of information within JustEnough, helping you to quickly drive inventory-related decisions. Within the Item Manager, you can build reports, manage inventory-level policies, and more.</p>
        <h2>Filter-driven item management</h2>
        <p>The most powerful feature within JustEnough is undoubtedly the ability to streamline workflow processes through the concept of management by exception. By using dynamic exception filters within Item Manager, you can quickly identify items which require your attention and go to work on them immediately.  Using dynamic filters should be an important everyday task for demand planners, buyers, and supply chain managers. You can even tie these filters to a dashboard, making it easy to prioritize your work in JustEnough.</p>
        <h2>Centralized information</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Inventory information such as inventory ID, stock on hand, and cost price.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Customizable views</h2>

        <h2>Life cycle management </h2>
