        <h1 >Supply Chain</h1>
        <p>Users may view and edit the supply information for the specific inventory. Lead time, order multiple, and both minimum and maximum order quantities may be adjusted at this level if applicable. </p>
        <p>Alternate suppliers may also be added (or removed) within this tab.</p>
        <h2>Allocation vs Replenishment information</h2>
        <p>The Supply Chain tab displays allocation- or replenishment-related information depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the </p>
        <p>Demand&#160;Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite ("Replenishment", for short).</p>
        <p>If you have both the Allocations module <i>and</i> the Replenishment suite enabled in your instance of JustEnough, the <b>Allocation Strategy Selection</b> field in the <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Strategy_1.htm">Allocation Strategy</a> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. You can add the <b>Execution Process</b> column to your Item Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are "Allocations engine" or "Replenishment engine".</p>
