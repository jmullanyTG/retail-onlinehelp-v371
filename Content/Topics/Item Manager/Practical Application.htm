        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p>Opening and building an item manager view is relatively simple task which gives users a high degree of flexibility. The easy to configure views can be used to create ad-hoc reports for any information within JustEnough. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Views may be created and opened in separate tabs within the item manager module. Upon opening a new view, users will be prompted to select a filter of inventories. </p>

        <p>This can be a static filter, or one of the many dynamic filters, all of which are managed through the filters module. </p>

        <p>Fields are organized by category and may be included or excluded by category, or individually. </p>
