        <p>The Windows Event Logging sub-system records any Error / Exception or change of state that occurs in any of the other subsystems or services in JEBDS including JEBDS itself. This sub-system records these Error / Exceptions or state change information into the windows Event Logger so that JustEnough has black box telemetry data to do a post mortem if any of the systems fail or transition to a torn state. This recorded data also allows us to determine the overall health of JEBDS in order to be able to perform proactive maintenance if required. </p>
