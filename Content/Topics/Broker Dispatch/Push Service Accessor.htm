        <p>The Push Service Accessor sub-system is an endpoint listener to the Push Service that listens for Action Messages that are placed into the database. The core concepts of this sub-system is what JEBDS is built upon and without this critical system JEBDS would not be possible. In addition to listening for new Action Messages to execute through JEBDS, Push Service Accessor provides methods to post new Action Messages into the Database for other Push Service Endpoint Listeners to pick up and action or for JEBDS to execute, although the later scenario though possible is not desirable in most cases.</p>
