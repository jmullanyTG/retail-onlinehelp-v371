        <h1>JustEnough Broker Dispatch Service</h1>
        <p>The JustEnough Broker Dispatch Service (JEBDS) is a windows service that is comprised of a collection of contained services and sub-systems. This allows JEBDS to be able to achieve its two primary requirements of providing generic bi-directional endpoints between the JustEnough Database and JustEnough Developed Endpoints and being able to execute jobs or tasks at a scheduled time, whilst providing granular control on how resources are used for each Action Message execution. </p>
        <p>As can be seen from <a href="Execute Action Message Allow_1.htm#_Annexure_A_–"><span class="Hyperlink">Annexure A</span></a>, JEBDS is a standalone windows service that communicates directly with our BLL web services where it augments all of our existing methods and services. To place an analogy on what JEBDS is similar to, one has to look no further than the Supply Chain or Distribution Channels of the Postal Service. Whilst the Push Service is considered the heart of the JustEnough Action Message system with very limited routing capabilities (it requires listeners to be subscribed to the Push Service), JEBDS provides the much needed general routing (it is a listener subscribed to the Push Service) and resource management required for Action Message processing where end users are not necessarily interacted with. Thus JEBDS supplies the required infrastructure for backend process to be able to execute jobs or tasks and communicate or interact with one each other in a very scalable and asynchronous manner.</p>
        <p>If one is to examine <a href="Annexure B JustEnough Broker.htm#_Annexure_B_–"><span class="Hyperlink">Annexure B</span></a>, one can observe the various services and sub-systems JEBDS is comprised of and the flow of how these systems interact with each other. JEBDS contains the following services and sub-systems: <a href="Logging Service.htm#_Logging_Service"><span class="Hyperlink">Logging Service</span></a>, <a href="Scheduling Service.htm#_Scheduling_Service"><span class="Hyperlink">Scheduling Service</span></a>, <a href="Dispatch Accessor.htm#_Dispatch_Accessor"><span class="Hyperlink">Dispatch Accessor</span></a>, <a href="Push Service Accessor.htm#_Push_Service_Accessor"><span class="Hyperlink">Push Service Accessor</span></a>, <a href="Job Manager Accessor.htm#_Job_Manager_Accessor"><span class="Hyperlink">Job Manager Accessor</span></a> and <a href="Action Message Coordinator.htm#_Action_Message_Coordinator"><span class="Hyperlink">Action Message Coordinator</span></a>.</p>
