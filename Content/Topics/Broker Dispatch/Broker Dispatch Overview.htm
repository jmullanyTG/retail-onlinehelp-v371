        <h1>Broker Dispatch Overview</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to specify the basic high level concepts of the JustEnough Broker Dispatch Service, detailing the domains it provides solutions for as well as how this system augments the JustEnough Solution in its entirety.</p>
        <p>The JustEnough Broker Dispatch Service (JEBDS) primarily solves two requirements for JustEnough. The first and most important objective is that the JEBDS provides a generic end point for the Database processes (Stored Procedures / Functions / General SQL scripts) to communicate bi-directionally with JustEnough Developed Endpoints (Web services / Engines / Smart Clients). This allows the Database to be able to address or call JustEnough Developed Endpoints and receive computed results or execute actions originating from these endpoints on their behalf.</p>
        <p>The second objective the JEBDS solves is providing a time based job scheduler which will facilitate the execution of JustEnough specific jobs or tasks periodically at either fixed times, dates or intervals. In addition JEBDS will replace JustEnoughs’ existing scheduler mechanism with a more intelligent and robust solution, be more performant and reliable, and cater for even more scenarios whilst allowing the system to have more granular control over its execution modes.</p>
