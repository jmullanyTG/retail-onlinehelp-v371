        <h1><a name="_JustEnough_Database_Logging"></a>JustEnough Database Logging Service Accessor</h1>
        <p>The JustEnough Database Logging Service Accessor is responsible for recording the Execution of the Action Message that flows through JEBDS. The following types of messages are usually logged through this channel, Action Message has started, Action Message has Completed, Action Message is currently running and Action Message has been discarded, and Any Exception / Error that is raised from the Action Message Execution. </p>
        <p>In addition this type of logging allows JustEnough to be able to account for every Action Message that passes through the entire solution, and to provide a deterministic way to be able to verify that the required action or task was executed successfully or not and when this occurred. Alternatively, one can use this logging to determine timings of Actions which can provide insight as to how the system is performing as a whole given a set of resources.</p>
