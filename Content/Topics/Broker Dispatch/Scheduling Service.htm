        <h1><a name="_Scheduling_Service"></a>Scheduling Service</h1>
        <p>The Scheduling Service provides a mechanism to produce Action Messages that will in turn be interpreted and eventually call into the <a href="Job Manager Accessor.htm#_Job_Manager_Accessor"><span class="Hyperlink">Job Manager Accessor</span></a>, periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. The schedules are specified by the JustEnough Job and Task Manager configuration. In essence this sub-system provides the mechanism to execute actions proactively at determined times.</p>
