        <h1>How To Introduce New Items Into Your Stores</h1>
        <p>Introducing new products into stores can challenge even the most savvy retailer. There are a myriad of issues that must be addressed before stock can hit the shelves, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> How to forecast demand for items with no sales histories of their own?</li>
            <li>Are the new items meant to replace existing stock or be sold alongside it?</li>
            <li>What is the anticipated life cycle for the new items?</li>
            <li>Which locations should receive the new items, and in what quantities?</li>
            <li>What item, site, and supply chain parameters govern how many units can be ordered at a time, and when those orders need to be placed?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fortunately, JustEnough has a solution that addresses each of these issues (and others like them!). </p>
        <h2>Solution: JustEnough's new item introduction workflow</h2>
        <p>This solution, illustrated below, helps take the worry out of introducing new items into your supply chain. By following this workflow, you can get your new products into the right stores at the right time with the right quantities.</p>
        <p><a href="../../../Resources/PDFs/JustEnough Workflows.pdf#page=11" title="Click to open workflow" alt="Click to open workflow"><img src="../../../Resources/PDFs/JustEnough Workflows.pdf#11" class="workflow" /></a>
        </p>
        <p>In this workflow, new items are created in your ERP system and sent to JustEnough. Once the new item appears in JustEnough, choose a strategy for determining which stores will receive the new item and in what quantities. The right strategy for each item will depend on the specifics of that item and of your own JustEnough implementation.</p>
        <p>You can choose from the following new item strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Using Supersessions to Introduce New Items into Your Supply Chain.htm">Supersessions</a> - choose this strategy when your new items are replacing existing items in your stores, or have similar sales histories.</li>
            <li>Curves &amp; Profiles - choose this strategy to forecast demand for new items based on sets of exisitng items with well-established product lifecycles.</li>
            <li>Allocation - choose this strategy when you are using JsutEnough's Allocations feature to allocate items to your stores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have followed the steps for adding the new item in its chosen strategy, JustEnough will generate optimized purchase orders for the item  based on the parameters specified for your items, suppliers, and sites.</p>
