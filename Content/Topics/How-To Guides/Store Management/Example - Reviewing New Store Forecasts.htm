        <h1>Example - Reviewing New Store Forecasts</h1>
        <p>Once forecasts have been generated for a new store--either manually or automatically as part of an overnight process--you can review the forecasts for items in your new store.  In this example, we'll look at the forecasted demand for an item at a new store in Calgary</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Manage tab, click <b>Item Manager</b>.</li>
            <li>In the Items dialog box, select the <b>Forecast Review: Coats &amp; Jackets - Retail</b> filter.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the item document, filter the Site Name column for Calgary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Double-click on an item to display its Details pane.</li>
            <li>In the Details pane, open the Forecast Viewer tab to see the demand that JustEnough forecasted for the item at the new Calgary store, based on the store supersession <a href="../../Site Manager/Example - Creating a Store Supersession.htm">created previously</a>.<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Item Manager/Example - New Store Item Forecast.png" /></li>
            <li>You can repeat these steps for other items at the Calgary site until you are satisfied with the demand forecasting for the new store.</li>
            <li>If further revisions are required, you can adjust the <a href="../../Site Manager/Example - Creating a Store Supersession.htm">store supersession</a> and any related <a href="../../Supersessions/Example - Using Supersessions to Generate Demand Forecasts.htm">item supersessions</a> as necessary. (For example, the new site may not have been added to an item supersession, resulting in no sales or forecasts for the item at Calgary.)</li>
