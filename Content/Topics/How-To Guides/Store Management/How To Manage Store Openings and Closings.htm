        <h1>How To Manage Store Openings and Closings</h1>
        <p>JustEnough lets you manage inventory supply and demand through all stages of a location's life cycle: opening, ongoing operation, renovation, and closing. </p>
        <p>Long before a store opens, you can use JustEnough's modeling and forecasting capabilities to anticipate demand at the new store and ensure inventory is ready to meet that demand. When it is time to temporary close a location (such as for renovations) JustEnough can help you adjust demand forecasts and replenishment strategies accordingly. And when permanent closures are required, JustEnough can help you draw down inventory and manage any leftover stock.</p>
