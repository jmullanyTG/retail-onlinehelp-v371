        <h1>Customizing Layouts</h1>
        <p>A layout is the combination of pivots, filters, and data fields (metrics) that appear in the Hybrid Financial Planning Grid. You can easily customize a layout by adding or removing fields, applying filters, and aggregating or disaggregating metrics. Once a layout is set up to your liking, you can save it for later use. </p>
