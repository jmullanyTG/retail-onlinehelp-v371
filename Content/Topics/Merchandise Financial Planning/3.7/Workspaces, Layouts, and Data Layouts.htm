        <h1>Workspaces, Layouts, and Data Layouts</h1>
        <p>The Financial Planning module makes it easy to design workspaces and layouts that drive versatility and take the pain out of switching between different areas of a financial plan. </p>
        <p>The three ways you can customize the Financial Planning screen are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b><a href="#Customiz">Workspace</a></b>. Workspaces represent the arrangement of tabs and panes on (and off) the screen. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MFP/workspace example.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b><a href="#Sav">Layout</a></b>. A layout is the combination of the row and column groupings that create the pivot grid (typically product, channel, and time period); plus any filters on row and column headers; plus the data fields (metrics) whose values appear inside the Hybrid Financial Planning Grid.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MFP/layout example.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Data Layout</b>. A data layout is the set of data fields contained in a given layout. Opening a data layout changes the metrics displayed in the grid while leaving your current row and column groupings (as well as any filters) intact. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../Resources/Images/MFP/data layout example.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can mix and match workspaces, layouts, and data layouts. For example, you can choose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> A workspace that maximizes the Hybrid Financial Grid by hiding the Calculation Direction Toggles and Locks On Selected Data panes; </li>
            <li>A layout that contains the pivots  (channel, product, and time periods) and filters for the areas of the plan you are responsible for, along with the basic set of metrics you want to work on; </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you work on your plan, if you want to see a different set of metrics while preserving the current workspace, pivots, and filters, you can simply select a new data layout and only the data fields displayed in the grid will change. Your workspace, pivots, and filters will persist until you choose to change them. </p>
        <p>This versatility lets you use layouts to drive your work, making it easy to switch scenarios without sacrificing time or convenience. </p>
