        <h1>Major Changes in this Version</h1>
        <p>Version 3.7 includes the following major changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auto Lock on Cell Change option</b>. You can now choose to have sales-related cell values lock automatically after you update them, without having to continually interrupt your flow to click the Lock button.&#160;This optFor more information, see <a href="Auto Lock on Cell Change.htm">Auto Lock on Cell Change</a>.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>New Save/Restore Data Layout feature</b>. There are now two options for saving and restoring planning view layouts. The existing <b>Save/Restore Layout</b> feature saves and restores the entire layout of the planning grid (row fields, column fields, data fields, and filters). A new feature, <b>Save/Restore Data Layout</b>, lets you save and restore the fields used as metrics in the data area of the planning grid <u>independently</u> of the pivot fields used to aggregate the data into rows and columns. This lets you easily switch the metrics displayed in a layout without having to recreate the product/location/time dimensions and filters in your current layout. For more information, see Customizing Layouts.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>New folder structure for organizing saved layouts</b>. You can now create folders in which to save layouts, making it easy to find the layout you want to use. For more information, see .</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Consolidation of planning views into new Hybrid Financial Planning Grid. </b>A singe new planning view replaces the 3 planning views (Main Planning View, Comp/Non-Comp Planning View, and Sales By Type Planning View) that appeared in previous versions. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">For more information, see</span> .</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>DC&#160;stock is now split by supply chain. </b>The logic related to how stock is split among DCs has been improved.
