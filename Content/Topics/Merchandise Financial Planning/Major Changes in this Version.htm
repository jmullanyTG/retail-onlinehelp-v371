        <h1 class="Heading1">Major Changes in this Version</h1>
        <p>Users of previous versions of JustEnough Merchandise Financial Planning should make note of the following major changes in version 3.7:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Improved User Experience and Performance</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Server Centric Architecture</b> – this version of Merchandise Financial Planning provides improved overall performance to the user by pushing computationally intensive calculations to the server for processing. This change allows more consistent performance across all users in your organization by minimizing dependence on less powerful client side machines.</li>
            <li><b>Single Widget Design</b> – the previous version of Merchandise Financial Planning relied on a two-widget design – one for Cost based plans and one for Retail based plans. This design often required that changes made to calculations, formatting, etc. be made in both widgets. The new version is built on a single widget that handles both Cost and Retail based plans, making calculation adjustments for each method seamless to the user and making widget maintenance and adjustments more streamlined for technical consultants.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamic Data Column Loading</b> – expanding upon the long-standing ability of users to create, save, and recall custom layouts, as of version 3.6.2, Merchandise Financial Planning now employs dynamic loading and unloading of data columns based on those present in the active layout. This allows users to gain an added performance benefit when viewing focused subsets of metrics while planning. While many factors can influence overall system performance, generally speaking, the fewer metrics present in a layout, the faster the performance will be.</li>
            <li><b>Aggregation Levels</b> – to further improve performance in this version of Merchandise Financial Planning, Channel level and Product level aggregation selectors are now present in the parameters area of the Main Planning View. By allowing users to select the lowest level of the product and site hierarchies that they wish to work on in the current view, the system can pre-aggregate data to the selected levels, thus reducing the number of rows that must be read for calculations.</li>
            <li><b>Live Calc Toggles Replace Lock Types</b> – previous versions of Merchandise Financial Planning required that users select and apply a Lock Type, determining which metrics would be open for manipulation by users and what dependent metrics would be affected. In this version, users can still choose which dependent metrics are affected by changes made to the plan, but they do so through live Calc Toggles, accessible through a right side panel that can be hidden or shown as desired. All plannable metrics are open for editing at all times, regardless of the Calc Toggles selected, and changes to Calc Toggle selections no longer require a refresh of the planning grid to become active – simply choose the desired Calc Toggle for each metric and plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Expanded Functionality</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Plan Approval Workflow</b> – version 3.6.0 introduces a new plan status structure and approval workflow, allowing for greater control of data flow between Master and Branch plans; plan approval is rights-based and provides separate notes sections for both submitters and approvers, creating an integrated feedback loop within each plan.</li>
            <li><b>Hybrid Cost-Retail Metric Set</b> – in speaking with many planning organizations throughout the industry, probably the most common request we have heard is the desire to include certain metrics from either Cost or Retail methods in the other method to provide a more balanced understanding of the plan. In version 3.6.0, Merchandise Financial Planning now offers a full set of Cost and Retail metrics regardless of which Accounting Method you choose as your plan basis, thus metrics such as BOP/EOP Cost are available in Retail Method, BOP/EOP Retail are available in Cost, and so on.</li>
            <li><b>Enhanced Comp/Non-Comp Planning</b> – this version introduces an entirely new view for planning comp/non-comp sales splits within the context of the larger plan. Site comp status is still determined through the import of external data, but the system now uses historical data to provide initial comp/non-comp splits for the plan. From there, users can individually manage comp/non-comp sales mix at any levels of the product/site hierarchies, and time. These splits aggregate up to Total Sales, Total Sales Units, and Total AUR, which are always equal to Sales, Sales Units, and AUR in the main planning view for the corresponding level. Changes made in the main planning view push down to comp/non-comp sales, respecting the established splits, so the plan always stays in-sync as you edit it.</li>
            <li><b>Sales By Type Planning</b> – similar to the Comp/Non-Comp view, this version also introduces a view for planning sales splits by sales type. Now users can fine tune the sales mix in Sales, Sales Units, and AUR for regular, promotional, and markdown sales for any level of the product/site hierarchy and by time. As with the Comp/Non-Comp view, historical data is used to provide initial splits by type for future plan periods. Any changes made to sales metrics in the main planning view push down through the established splits by sales type. Note that Comp/Non-Comp and Sales By Type views are linked through the Total Sales metrics, with changes to the individual components in each updating those metrics and then pushing down through the established splits. Component level changes will not, however, alter the splits from one view to the other.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-Level Lock &amp; Spread</b> – another feature we’ve received a great deal of requests for within Merchandise Financial Planning is the functionality known as Lock &amp; Spread. Version 3.6.0 adds this functionality with the ability to lock Sales and dependent metrics at multiple levels of the product/site hierarchies and time concurrently. Locking the lowest levels of the current view freezes the locked values, allowing users to make further changes to the plan and “spreading” those changes around the locked levels. Locking at aggregate levels provides the added feature of constraining values at levels beneath to the locked total, thus changes beneath will cause other unlocked levels to change while always adding up to the locked total. Locks at both levels can be combined to allow for precise fine tuning of the plan without ending up in an endless circle of changes, trying to reach a desired outcome.</li>
            <li><b>DC Stock Inclusion</b> – lastly, with version 3.6.0, we’ve added the inclusion of DC stock to the plan so users can better understand their total inventory position by site level. We employ a splitting algorithm to determine the most optimal distribution of DC inventory, given a user definable number of periods into the future. The system looks at planned sales, receipts, and overall inventory flow to determine where DC stock is most needed, helping users understand how best to achieve their plans through not only new receipts but also proper utilization of existing inventory.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Support of Legacy Plan Types</h2>
        <p>Legacy Cost, Retail, and Location plan types are still supported in this version of Merchandise Financial Planning and can be viewed and edited normally. It is important to note, however, that none of the major enhancements noted above apply to these plan types, nor are there any plans to retrofit the legacy types with these changes in the future. Furthermore, no additional feature or performance enhancements will be added to legacy plan types going forward.</p>
        <p>Clients wishing to continue planning forward with legacy type plans may do so in consideration of the above statement at their own discretion. It is recommended, however, that they use the Rebalance functionality described later in this guide to port information from existing legacy type plans into the new Hybrid type plans, so they can benefit from the many improvements Hybrid types offer over their predecessors.</p>
        <p>With specific regard to location plans, while there is no direct analog to this type among the Hybrid plan types, due to the dynamic loading of data columns based on their inclusion in a given layout, it is possible to create plans extending down to the site level with any Hybrid plan type and work in them without significant performance degradation. To facilitate this, views created and employed for use with site level plans should be limited to functional subsets for supporting different stages of the planning process. The exact number of metrics that can be displayed in a given view without degradation of performance will vary based on a variety of factors, including the breadth, depth, and aggregation levels of your data selection parameters and the speed of your network connection, but generally speaking, the fewer metrics returned, the faster the performance will be.</p>
