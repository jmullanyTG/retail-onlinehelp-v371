        <p style="color: #000000;">Lock &amp; Spread functionality provides users with the ability to lock Sales and dependent metrics at multiple levels of the product/site hierarchies and time concurrently. Locks at both aggregate and lower levels can be combined to allow for precise fine tuning of the plan without ending up in an endless circle of changes, trying to reach a desired outcome.</p>
