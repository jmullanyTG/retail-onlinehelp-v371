        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Below are some tips and examples to help the user get the most out of the available functionality in the Plan creation and Plan management sections of this module.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">When configuring or setting up Merchandise Financial Planning it’s important to set up the user rights properly to support the plan approval process.&#160; Ensure only authorized users have the rights to approve/reject and merge plans.&#160; This helps to maintain master plan integrity.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Before approving plans, it is a good idea to create an additional branch of the plan that will take on the merged changes.&#160; Once a plan has been merged to another, it’s difficult to revert back to the plans that existed prior to the merge or approval process.&#160; This will make it easier to revert back to the plans that existed prior to any approval or merge.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Create a plan review calendar to establish deadlines for Pre-season and In-season plan reviews.&#160; Users will be able to take full advantage of the plan approval functionality if they know their due dates.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Limit the number of branches that need approved during the plan approval process.&#160; Creating branches that contain multiple product and location dimensions cuts down on the number of plans to be reviewed and approved.&#160; This will help to streamline the process, especially for In-season plan reviews.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Take advantage of the notes section during the approval or rejection process.&#160; This will allow the user to focus on the area of the plan that needs reviewed or adjusted.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Remind users that the notification inbox contains all the changes made in the Plan approval process.&#160; This is where they will see the progress being made during plan reviews.</li>
        </ul>
