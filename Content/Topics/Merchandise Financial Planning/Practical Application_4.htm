        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">The examples above provide a good basic understanding of Lock &amp; Spread functionality, but let’s have a look at a slightly more complex scenario to examine the power of the functionality in a real-world application</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #000000;">High Level Target Changes: </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">a very common scenario for planners is one in which we get all the details of our plan just the way we want them and then we learn we must take the entire plan up or down by a certain percentage, but we still have specific lower level targets that we must adhere to</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Practical Application_4.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 337px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">Let’s say we’ve built our 2017_m08 Sales plan to $50K across 3 brands</span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">, and have just been asked to take the total plan up 10%</span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">. Great Value currently accounts for 50% of the business, but you’ve been instructed to hold volume for this brand at $25K</span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">. Mainstay and Private Selection have been identified as growth brands so we can allow their monthly totals to rise. The only other constraint is that the totals for wk 32 and 34 for Private Selection need to remain intact. This can easily be accomplished by using locks to hold the specified month and week values then using the </span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #000000;">right click &gt; Multiple Changes </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">function to increase the 2017_m08 Sales Grand Total</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Practical Application_4_1.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 269px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;margin-left: 36pt;font-style: italic;color: #000000;">By choosing the second option in the Multiple Data Change Form and setting it to increase the value by 10%, we will raise the monthly grand total to $55K (this functionality is shown for the purpose of example in to use in cases where the % increase is not so simply calculated)</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Practical Application_4_2.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 337px;" />
        </p>
        <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;margin-left: 36pt;font-style: italic;color: #000000;">Note the entire plan for the month has recalculated to the new target of $55K, while keeping the locked month and week totals intact and increasing the unlocked periods relative to their previous percent contribution. In this manner, the we are able to maintain the mandatory specifics and overall spirit in which the plan was created very quickly and easily</p>
