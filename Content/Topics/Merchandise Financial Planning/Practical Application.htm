        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Below are some tips and examples to help the user get the most out of the available functionality in the Plan creation and Plan management sections of this module.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master/Branch Plan set up</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">tips:</span></li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Master plan should contain all necessary product and location hierarchical components to properly manage an OTB process.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Stay at a level that is reasonable in terms of the layers available to plan.&#160; When managing an OTB think of the spending on receipts and how to manage that spend at an executive type level.&#160; Executives don’t want information that is too granular, so keep it at a level that is effective and everyone in the organization can understand.&#160; An example would be planning at a category level or layer below division.&#160; If total Female was a division and underneath that layer is categories of product such as denim, skirts, dresses, blouses, etc.&#160; It’s very easy to see where the growth and declines of the business are occurring at that level.&#160; Spend the time managing the OTB at that level in order to move inventory investment into the right categories at the right time.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Create a master working branch underneath the master plan.&#160; A master branch simply contains everything in the hierarchical structure for product and location.&#160; This becomes the branch that everyone moves their changes into.&#160; This allows for a holistic review of the business prior to approving a plan to merge into the master.&#160; Users can then create their own branches off the master branch and merge their changes into the master branch.&#160; Ensure the end date of this branch goes out as far as possible into the future.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">When setting up read/write access for users, consider how much data you want them to see vs. how much data you want them to edit.&#160; An example would be to give the Women’s denim planner write access for that category, but read access for total women’s.&#160; They have the ability to make changes to Denim, but can also understand what is happening in total Women’s.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">When creating branches to edit the plans and there is a formal plan approval process in place, branch off the time periods that should be reviewed and approved.&#160; This will streamline the process and is very helpful when conducting in-season plan reviews.&#160; Additionally, upon approval, only the changes to those time periods will be merged to the parent branch or master plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Snapshot Utilization: </span>utilize snapshots as part of the plan review and approval process.&#160; When a plan has been approved, take a snapshot so that there is record of the plans at that point in time.&#160; It will make it easier for the users to understand Plan vs. Actual and the variance between the two</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Snapshot Templates to Schedule Regular Snapshots: </span>snapshot templates can be created to automatically take snapshots on a regular schedule. Schedule snapshots to be taken of the Master plan and Master working branch every week.&#160; That will make reviewing the business simple and easy as the comparisons of plan vs. actual on a weekly basis will be available directly in the main planning view</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">n Appropriate Calendar Level: </span>if week to week planning is an important part of the business, the calendar level should be week.&#160; Otherwise select Month as the calendar level.&#160; </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Create User Specific </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Master and </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Branch Plans: </span>be cognizant of the intended users when creating branch and sub-branch plans. Creating branches that only contain the product/site levels each user is responsible for will speed the planning process by limiting the amount of data the system has to read and process for each transaction. If your organization includes planners that are specifically concerned with higher levels of the product/site hierarchies, you can also create additional Master plans for them that don’t include the lower levels of the hierarchy. These plans can ultimately be reconciled with lower level plans via Rebalance functionality.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Adding New Leaf Levels to Existing Plan Hierarchies: </span><span style="color: #000000;">as your business evolves, you will naturally want to add new product/site levels to your existing plans. Once the new leaf levels are created within the desired ItemMaster/Site Group(s), first use the Initialize functionality on the Master plan, selecting </span><span style="color: #FF0000;">ONLY THE NEW LEVEL(s) </span><span style="color: #000000;">to be added. Once complete, you can now use the Reseed functionality on the branch plans beneath that master, again selecting </span><span style="color: #FF0000;">ONLY THE NEW LEVEL(s)</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that were added to the master</span><span style="color: #000000;">. In this manner, you can set up new levels in your existing plans without losing the data for the existing levels</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #000000;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">“leaf” level refers to an additional entity within an existing ItemMaster/Site Group. </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">For example, say SiteGroup 4 is Site and contains the sites Tempe, Flagstaff, and Phoenix. If I add a new entity called Sierra Vista for a new site that is opening, this is adding a new leaf level to SiteGroup 4</span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">. </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #FF0000;">The above example does not pertain to adding a new structure level. An example of adding a new structure level would be if I have a Site Hierarchy consisting of SiteGroups 1-4: Company, Country, District, Site and then I want to insert a new SiteGroup – Region – in between Country and District. This type of change constitutes a hierarchy restructure and requires that a new Master plan be created.</span>
