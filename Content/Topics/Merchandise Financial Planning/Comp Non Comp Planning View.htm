        <p style="color: #000000;">The Comp/Non-Comp planning view is where users will plans Sales, Sales Units, and Average Unit Retails for their comparative and non-comparative components of the business.&#160; Regardless of which method of inventory valuation, Cost or Retail, is in use for the active plan. Through creative use of PivotGrid functionality, users can quickly aggregate, disaggregate, and rearrange fields in the view, allowing for a more intuitive and fluid process. In contrast with previous versions of MFP, version 3.6.0 allows for live editing of all plannable metrics without the need to invoke lock types.</p>
