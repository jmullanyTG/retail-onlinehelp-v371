        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;color: #000000;">The Sales by Type planning view works exactly the same as the main planning view in terms of core functionality.&#160; The purpose of this tab is to allow for the budgeting of growth and/or decline up and down the product and location hierarchies over time in order to be able to determine the sales activity in these segments of the business.&#160; Regular price business is typically defined as the segment of the business whereby units are sold at the point of sale at the original ticket price or full price.&#160; Promotional business is typically defined as the segment of the business whereby units are sold at point of sale on promotion or a reduced price for a temporary period of time.&#160; Markdown business is typically defined as the segment of business whereby units are sold at the point of sale on clearance or a reduced price or prices permanently.&#160; The key aspect of planning sales by type and focusing on these three segments is to establish a total AUR that makes sense based on the expected activity or sales that occur from these segments.&#160; Planning the sales mix in this manner provides greater visibility to normal pricing fluctuations and whether or not the revenue generated is expected to come from full prices sales, promotional events or permanent markdowns.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>The parameters selected in the main planning view are connected to the Sales by Type planning view.&#160; If a user makes any changes to the parameters defined in the header area, this will update for the main planning view as well as the Sales by Type planning view.&#160; Additionally, the calculation toggles and the locks that are invoked will be consistent with the selections made in the main planning view.</p>
        <p>The user has the ability to change the sales metrics for the Regular price, Promotional and Markdown segments of the business.&#160; In making changes to any of the three groupings, this can have an effect on the main planning view and the total sales related to the plan.&#160; Below is an example of how this works:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_6_2.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 633px;height: 717px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Total sales for the 2017_wk28 are $4.463.&#160; If the user changes the Reg. Sales metric for that period from $3,663 to $4,000, total sales will update in this tab and the main planning view simultaneously.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_6_3.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 723px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Reg. Sales for the period 2017_wk28 are now $4000 and have impacted the total sales plan updating that value to $4,800 for the same period.&#160; The same behavior applies if the user makes changes to the Promo Sales or Markdown Sales.&#160; </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Itâ€™s important to note for the first release of this functionality that when using the lock and spread functionality and locking a period, all four groupings will lock for the selected period.&#160; By the next major release we will be adding the ability to lock one of the four groupings and change the other groupings using the spread functionality for that period.</span></p>
