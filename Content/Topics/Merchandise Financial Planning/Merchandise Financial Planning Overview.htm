        <p><span style="color: #000000;">The JustEnough Merchandise Financial Planning module </span><span style="color: #000000;">is designed with the end-user in mind - combining</span> <span style="color: #000000;">essential</span><span style="color: #000000;"> planning </span><span style="color: #000000;">functionalities, such as Cost and Retail methods of accounting, calendar and period level configurability, and plan approval workflow with an innovative approach to data management and user interaction. In JustEnough MFP, selecting an accounting method is just the beginning – from there, users can define a custom metric set and views of their choosing from the full balanced set of metrics available to BOTH methods. Users have the ability to alter calculation direction for metrics where multiple directions may be desired (such as an option to calculate Sales Units or AUR when changing Sales) on the fly – without refreshing the screen for the change to take effect. Separate Comp/Non-comp and Sales By Type views allow users to manage their sales mix at more granular levels while seamlessly updating the overarching plan. Flexible metric locking capabilities allow users to both hold specific period level values while spreading changes around them and lock aggregate level values, constraining changes made at lower levels to the locked total</span><span style="color: #000000;">s. Lastly, all of this functionality is wrapped in a fully configurable PivotGrid, behaving much like a Microsoft Excel Pivot Table but allowing edits of plannable metrics at any level of the product, site, and time hierarchies and effortlessly aggregating and disaggregating data via simple drag-and-drop user actions.</span></p>
