        <p>Once a user has made their desired adjustments in the branch plan they are working in, they have the ability to send the plan to an authorized user for approval.&#160; If changes have been made to the branch plan, the plan status will be In-Progress.&#160; To send a plan to an authorized user for approval, the branch plan needs to be highlighted.&#160; </p>

        <p>Once the branch plan has been highlighted, the user will click on the submit button on the header of the Financial Plan Maintenance view.&#160; The Approve Financial Plan window will appear on the user’s screen.&#160; The name of the branch to be approved will be displayed to the user.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The user must select the destination plan for which the source plan is to be approved and merged to.&#160; In addition, the user has the ability to make any notes to the authorized approver to help them through the approval process.&#160; Finally, the user will select the authorized approver to send the plan to for review.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The system will send the plan information to the authorized approver for approval.&#160; The branch plan that has been submitted for approval will then move to a status of Awaiting Approval.&#160; If the plan is approved, the system will automatically merge the approved plan into the destination plan.&#160; The destination plan will change to a status of Approved and the merge history on the right hand side of the Financial Plan Maintenance view will update.&#160; The Merge history tab is an audit trail of approval process and displays to the user when merges were made to and from the plans that are being worked with.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The branch plan or source plan will remain in Approved status until changes are made, at which time, the status will revert back to In-Progress.&#160; If the plan is rejected and not approved, the information is sent back to the user with any notes documented by the authorized approver.&#160; To reject a plan, click on the Reject icon and the Reject Financial Plan window will be displayed on the user’s screen.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;">The authorized user will then make any notes and send back to the planner in order to make the requested changes to the plan.&#160; The plan will then take on the status of In-Progress.</p>
