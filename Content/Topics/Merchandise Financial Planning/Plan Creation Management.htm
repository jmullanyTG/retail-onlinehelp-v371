        <p><span style="color: #000000;">Managing Merchandise Financial Plans within the financial planning module begins with the Financial Plan Maintenance View.&#160; This view is where our clients will set up the structure of their plans for their target setting process.&#160; There are three main concepts for plans that we offer to our clients.&#160; The first concept for plans is the master plan.&#160; The master plan is considered the “single” version of truth and can only be edited through an approval and/or merge process.&#160; The second concept for plans is the branch plan.&#160; The branch plan can be a copy of the master plan or a copy of a branch plan.&#160; The branch concept is where users have the ability to make changes to their plans.&#160; The third concept for plans is the snapshot.&#160; Snapshots are locked down versions of a plan that cannot be edited and do not actualize.&#160; In </span><span style="color: #000000;">addition to the three main concepts for plans, we also offer as standard functionality the ability to plan based on the retail method of accounting and cost method of accounting.&#160; Location plans can also be created and managed in this view.</span>
