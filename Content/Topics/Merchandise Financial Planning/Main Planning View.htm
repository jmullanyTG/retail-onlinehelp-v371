        <h1 class="Heading1">Main Planning View</h1>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">The main planning view is where users will do most of their work within Merchandise Financial Planning. Regardless of which method of inventory valuation, Cost or Retail, is in use for the active plan, a full balanced set of both Cost and Retail related metrics will be available to the user to show or hide as needed, allowing vast customizability of the planning process through the use of saved layouts. Through creative use of PivotGrid functionality,</span><span style="color: #000000;"> users can quickly aggregate, disaggregate, and rearrange fields in </span><span style="color: #000000;">the view, allowing for a more intuitive and fluid process.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> In contrast with previous versions of MFP, version 3.6.0 allows for live editing of all plannable metrics without the need to invoke lock types.</span>
