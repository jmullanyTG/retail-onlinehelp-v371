        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;color: #000000;">The Comp and Non-Comp planning view works exactly the same as the main planning view in terms of core functionality.&#160; The purpose of this tab is to allow for the budgeting of growth and/or decline up and down the product and location hierarchies over time in order to be able to determine the sales activity in these segments of the business.&#160; Comparative business is typically defined as the segment of the business that has been active for a period of more than 12 months.&#160;&#160; Non-Comparative business is typically defined as the segment of the business that has only been active for 12 months or less. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The parameters selected in the main planning view are connected to the comp/non-comp planning view.&#160; If a user makes any changes to the parameters defined in the header area, this will update for the main planning view as well as the comp/non-comp planning view.&#160; Additionally, the calculation toggles and the locks that are invoked will be consistent with the selections made in the main planning view.</p>
        <p>The user has the ability to change the sales metrics for the comp and non-comp groupings.&#160; In making changes to either of the two groupings, this can have an effect on the main planning view and the total sales related to the plan.&#160; Below is an example of how this works:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_5_2.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 567px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Total sales for the 2017_wk30 are $3,626.&#160; If the user changes the Comp Sales metric for that period from $2,626 to $3,000, total sales will update in this tab and the main planning view simultaneously.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Essential Business Concepts_5_3.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 634px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Comp Sales for the period 2017_wk30 are now $3000 and have impacted the total sales plan updating that value to $4000 for the same period.&#160; The same behavior applies if the user makes changes to the Non-Comp Sales.&#160; </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Note:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Itâ€™s important to note for the first release of this functionality that when using the lock and spread functionality and locking a period, all three groupings will lock for the selected period.&#160; By the next major release we will be adding the ability to lock one of the three groupings and change the other groupings using the spread functionality for that period.</span></p>
