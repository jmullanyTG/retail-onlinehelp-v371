        <p style="color: #000000;">As part of the 3.6.0 release JustEnough has introduced a more robust standard plan approval process into the financial planning module.&#160; This means that our clients have the ability to review, approve, reject and merge branch plans as needed.&#160; These plan statuses can support pre-season and in-season plan reviews.&#160; The process of reviewing, approving, rejecting and merging plans is contained within the Financial Plan Maintenance view.</p>
