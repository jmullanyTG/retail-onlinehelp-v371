        <h1 >Aggregate Level Locks</h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;color: #000000;">Locks engaged at levels above the lowest level in the current view are considered aggregate level locks. Depending on the configuration of your view, it is possible to have multiple aggregate level locks engaged beneath a higher aggregate level, such as multiple month level locks beneath a grand total for all time shown in the view</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">Example</span><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;color: #0070C0;">: </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">another common scenario is when the user wants to lock month level sales so that all values beneath constrain to the total as changes are made</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Aggregate Level Locks.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 197px;" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">In the example above, Sales has been locked for 2017_m08, </span><span style="font-style: italic;color: #000000;">also locking Sales Units and AUR at the month aggregate level in the view</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/MFP/Aggregate Level Locks_1.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 196px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;margin-left: 36pt;font-style: italic;color: #000000;">In this case, 2017_wk33 Sales was increased to $10,000. The system subtracts the entered $10,000 from the locked monthly total of $25,000 and distributes the remaining $15,000 across the 3 remaining unchanged periods by taking their percent contribution to the Sales total, rebalancing them to equal 100%, then multiplying by $19,956</p>
