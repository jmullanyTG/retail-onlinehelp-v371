        <h1 >Technical Note on Customizations</h1>
        <p>To our technical consultants, we recognize that specific business needs will vary greatly from client to client, giving rise to the need for customizations. This new version of MFP can absolutely be customized with additional metrics to help meet client needs, however <span style="font-weight: bold;">in order to maintain the stability of the carefully balanced calculation model, the standard set of calculations should not be altered. </span>There are many metric interdependencies which may not be immediately apparent and changing the interactions of these metrics is likely to yield unpredictable results. That said, the addition of non-editable informational metrics that calculate based on the existing set is possible without repercussion. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If a client requires changes to the system that will alter standard calculations in any way, it is highly recommended that these be submitted as enhancement requests, so the product and development teams can ensure no unforeseen issues will arise.</span> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
