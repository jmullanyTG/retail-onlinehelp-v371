        <p>By managing all types of Promotions across all channels in a centralized system, companies now have the capability to coordinate Promotions across all departments that are involved in the process from merchandising to marketing and advertising.</p>
        <p>JustEnough gives you the power to easily and accurately plan successful future Promotions, incorporate their impact into the overall retail planning process and evaluate their effectiveness. The result is Promotions that attract new and existing customers, increase revenues and reduce inventory levels and marketing costs.</p>
        <p>You can group stores/Sites together within a Promotion so they can be targeted with common pricing strategies. Multiple Promotion strategies can be set by Site Cluster within a single Promotion to allow for easy management and monitoring. In addition, the products promoted for each Site Cluster in a Promotion can be varied to account for regional availability and targeting.</p>
        <p>There will be times when external factors that are not captured in the system will affect the performance of a Promotion. For these times, or for new products that are unique, planners can override the system generated forecast. You can configure which factors can be overridden and by whom. Additionally, all financial Calculations use the override values.</p>
        <p>While planning a new Promotion, it is vital to understand how and when the current product was promoted previously, and what the results were. We can compare side-by-side, the current Promotion with past Promotions and identify any potential problem areas or areas of opportunity.</p>
        <p>During the planning process, you can evaluate multiple scenarios to identify which variables will provide the desired results. You can change the Promotion strategy, customer segmentation, price, Promotional channel, vendor funding and many other configurable variables. The system then re-forecasts based on the new information. In addition, the boundaries that the forecasting engine uses can be constrained based on user preference within the approved corporate margin.</p>
        <p>When evaluating the effectiveness of Promotions it is vital to understand how they impacted the overall product category. Without this information, you may get a false reading on how well your Promotional efforts are contributing to the bottom line. JustEnough helps you identify the impact each Promotional offer had on the overall category in order to avoid cannibalization of other key products.</p>
