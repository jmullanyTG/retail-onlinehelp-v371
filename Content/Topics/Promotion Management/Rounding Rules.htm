        <p><span class="span_4">Rounding Rules allow </span><span class="span_4">you</span><span class="span_4"> to create grouped Rounding Criteria, to be applied to a Pr</span><span class="span_4">omotion</span><span class="span_4"> Calculation to conform to corporate price rounding standards. The solution can be configured with both ‘</span><span class="span_4">standard</span><span class="span_4">’ rounding as well as rounding with ‘price endings’.</span>
        </p>
        <p>‘Price Ending’ rounding refers to selection a numeric position and rounding it up/down/closest to the configured price ending value based on the preceding numeric position value.</p>
