        <h1 >Promotion Validation Statuses</h1>
        <p>The second column displays a symbol that indicates the Validation Status of the Promotion as outlined below (most severe to least):</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Red no entry</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Promotion Validation Statuses.png" style="width: auto;height: 20px;" /> – An error was found so you must review the Promotion to resolve the problem.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Orange exclamation</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Promotion Validation Statuses_1.png" style="height: 20px;width: auto;" /> – A Validation warning was encountered.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Green ‘i’</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Promotion Validation Statuses_2.png" style="width: auto;height: 12px;" /> – Validation ran successfully but additional information is available to review.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Red exclamation</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Promotion Validation Statuses_3.png" style="height: 20px;" /> – A Calculation is required before a Validation Status can be assigned, so you must either manually open the Promotion and recalculate, or it can be recalculated by an overnight process.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Green checkmark</span> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Promotion Validation Statuses_4.png" style="height: 20px;" /> – The Promotion is successfully validated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Validation is done at the Site Cluster level so it is possible for one Promotion to have one Site Cluster with a warning, another with information to review, etc. The Validation Status displayed at the Promotion level will be a roll up of the most severe Validation Statuses at the Site Cluster levels.</p>
