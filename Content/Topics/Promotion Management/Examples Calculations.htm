        <h1 >Examples: Calculations</h1>
        <p>Best practices require that null fields (i.e. fields that have no value) are not permitted to cause an error in the system while Calculations are being performed. In the examples that follow, the ISNULL() function is used frequently. This function will replace a null value with 0 thus ensuring that best practices are followed. In some cases, the ISNULL() function is used to determine if a price override has been keyed at a lower level. The price override would then be used in the Calculation, rather than the Promotion level keyed data.</p>
        <p><span class="span_2">Note</span><span class="span_3">: The Calculations may vary from these examples due to implementation requirements.</span>
