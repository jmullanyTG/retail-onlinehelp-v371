        <h1 >Promoted price or promoted discount type Promotion Strategies</h1>
        <p>For Promoted Price and Promoted Discount type Promotion Strategies there are three ways to add products. The three methods of adding products are not mutually exclusive and all three methods can be used within a Promotion.</p>
        <ul start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p><span class="span_1">Add Item / A</span><span class="span_1">dd Variant</span> – Click this button if you know the product code (e.g. SKU).</p>
                <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
                    <li class="ListParagraph">Enter individual product code(s) (for Variant or Item Master, depending on the global policy) into the textbox or paste product codes from the clipboard by clicking the <span class="span_1">Add Items From Clipboard</span> / <span class="span_1">Add Variants From Clipboard</span><span class="span_1">.</span></li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph">Once all the products have been added to the Promotion, they will be displayed in a group called Item Group below the Promotion Group.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul start="2" class="ol_1">

                <p><span class="span_1">Select to Add</span> – Use a filter to select products.</p>
                <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
                    <li class="ListParagraph">A Filter selection box will display. Select a filter from which you would like to select items from the dropdown list.</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph">If an appropriate Filter does not exist click on the black hammer icon to create a new Filter that will better match the list of items to select from.</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph">Once the appropriate Filter is selected click <span class="span_1">Ok</span>. Selecting the checkbox ‘Select only some items from the current filter’ will allow individual product selection from the selected filter.</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph">Once all the products have been added to the Promotion, they will be displayed in a group called Item Group below the Promotion Group.</li>

                    <li class="ListParagraph">
                        <p>Select the checkbox for each group to be added to the Promotion, then click <span class="span_1">OK</span>.</p>

                            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If the group you wish to add is not available, first ensure the Filter selected in the pop up is for “All Variants/Item Masters”. If still unavailable, navigate to Content Manager to create the group you require for the Promotion.</li>
                            <li class="ListParagraph_1">These groups are dynamic, meaning the system will update the associated products included in the group dependent on the filter criteria used to create the group. This update will only occur as long as the Promotion is in an unlocked state.</li>
                            <li class="ListParagraph_1">When adding a group to a Promotion, the system will create a copy of the original group, including the filter criteria used to define the Group, so that changes can be made at the Promotion level without affecting the originating product group.</li>
                        </ul>
