        <h1 class="Heading1">Promotion Management Configuration </h1>
        <p>It is almost impossible to provide an out-of-the-box configuration that would work for all customers in terms of promotion strategies, price calculations, validations and customer specific fields. As such JustEnough has built the Promotion Configuration tool, used to tailor the system to meet each customerâ€™s specific needs.&#160; The smaller configurable elements are combined into one Promotion Strategy configuration which drives the Calculations and Validations for each Promotion Type.</p>
