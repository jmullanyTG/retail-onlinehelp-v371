        <h1 >Price Detail – display positions (slots)</h1>
        <p>The second tab of the Price Detail screen allows you to assign the Promotion directly into an open Slot in an Event Slot Set. Ensure the <span class="span_1">Parameters</span> button is enabled. To load all available Slots, select ‘All’ from the Available Events View Option and click <span class="span_1">Execute</span>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The grid will then display a row for every Slot contained in an Event that has overlapping Sale Dates and some Sites in common with the current Promotion. <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Price Detail display positions slots_1.png" style="height: 419px;width: 623px;" class="img_1" /></p>
        <p>A checkmark in the ‘Assigned’ column signifies that the current Promotion has already been placed in that Slot. Event Slots do not appear in the grid, signify that either a different Promotion has been placed the Slot or you do not have access to the Space that the Slot is in. A Slot may be displayed across more than one row if the Promotion in the Slot is not associated with all Geographies in the Event.</p>
        <p>The ‘Available Events View Option’ dropdown list determines which accessible Slots from overlapping Events are displayed in the grid. Select one of the options below and click <span class="span_1">Execute</span> to alter the Slots displayed in the grid:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">All</span> – Show Slots that are available or assigned to the current Promotion.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Available</span> – Show Slots that do not have Promotions assigned to all Event Geographies.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1"><span class="span_1">Assigned</span> – Show Slots that the current Promotion has been assigned to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To assign the Promotion to an available Event Slot, place a checkmark in the ‘Assigned’ column of the applicable row in the grid, click <span class="span_1">Save</span> and click <span class="span_1">Ok</span> in the window. </p>
        <p>Once a Promotion has been assigned to a Slot, the pane on the right will load to display all of the Products and Product Groups associated with the Promotion.  </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Selecting the ‘Featured’ checkbox beside one Product (Item or Group) in this pane will apply the selected Product’s Master Content and the Pricing to the Event’s Slot. </p>
        <p>Click <span class="span_1">Save</span>, above the right pane, to apply the Content and Pricing selections to the Event Slot. The ability to push a specific Product’s Content and pricing is not available for BOGO AB type Promotions.</p>
