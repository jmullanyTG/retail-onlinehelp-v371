        <h1 >Promotion Strategies</h1>
        <p>This Promotion Strategies tab provides a method to assign Calculation Sets, Validation Sets, and Pricing Details to a Promotion Strategy. The configuration screen also allows the setup of mandatory and required fields that are seen in the Promotion Pricing grid as well as maintain whether Promotion Strategies are “active” (i.e. available for use). </p>
        <p>The Promotion Strategy Field Formats grid applies to all Promotion Strategies and lists all available price fields, including their format, when defining a Promotion Strategy.</p>
