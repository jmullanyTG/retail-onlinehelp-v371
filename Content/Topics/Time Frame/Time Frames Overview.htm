        <h1>Time Frame Overview</h1>
        <p>Time frames simply define the window(s) of time to use for a JustEnough operation, such as creating an Allocations <a href="../Allocations/Product Model.htm">product model</a> or generating a <a href="Changing the Time Frame for a Forecast.htm">demand forecast</a>. They are reusable across JustEnough modules and shareable with other users. </p>
        <h2>Static and dynamic options</h2>
        <p>You can create time frames based on static calendar dates (January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2017) or on date ranges that dynamically update on a rolling basis (last 180 days, next 90 days, etc.) </p>
        <h2>Support for multiple time periods</h2>
        <p>You can also create time frames that span multiple time ranges. For example, you may want a time frame that covers each January for the years 2015-2017. That time frame would include the following distinct date ranges: January 1-31, 2015; January 1-31, 2016; January 1-31, 2017.</p>
        <h2>Schedules support</h2>
        <p>For convenience, you can base a time frame on  schedules created in the Schedules module. Simply select the schedule you want to use and its effective dates are used for the time range.</p>
        <h2>Controlled Access</h2>
        <p>You can decide whether to keep a time frame private (for your use only), public (for use by any JustEnough role or user), or shared only with selected users or roles.</p>
        <h2>Central maintenance and local availability</h2>
        <p>The Time Frame module provides a <a href="Time Frame Maintenance Window.htm">centralized maintenance window</a> where you can create and edit time frames for use in other JustEnough modules. You can also access this maintenance area when <a href="Selecting a Time Frame.htm">selecting a time frame</a> in a supported JustEnough module, making it easy to view, edit, and create time frames without having to switch away from your current work area.</p>
