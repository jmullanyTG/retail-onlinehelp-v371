        <h1>Step 3.2.4: Capture Lost Sales </h1>
        <p>If the forecast exception is as a result of erratic sales, which can be attributed to stock outs and lost sales that occurred prior to the implementation of JustEnough, the User can capture historic Lost Sales quantities (lost sales occurring after the implementation of JustEnough should be calculated systematically). If the item was stocked out at all locations, the User can capture the Lost Sales quantities in the Level Forecast view. The Lost Sales quantities will be pushed down to the Inventory Level using the Forecast Split factor. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If the item was not stocked out at all stores it is advisable to capture the Lost Sales at the Inventory level. If the Lost Sales quantity is captured at the Level, it will be split to the Inventory Level using the sales contribution of the Item at each location, potentially resulting in the store(s) that did not stock out receiving a larger split portion of the Lost Sales captured at the Item Level.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The Lost Sales quantities can be manually captured in the Lost Sales field (note: not the Total Sales field).</p>
