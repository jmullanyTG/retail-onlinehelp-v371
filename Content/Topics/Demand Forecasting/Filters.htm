        <h3 >Filters</h3>
        <p>An inventory forecast will run the forecast engine at the inventory level (item at site, or SKU/location). Users will be presented with a choice of filters for selecting specific items and the forecast viewer will return all of the inventories for the selected filter. </p>
        <p>Users may view a static set of items based on certain item or site assigned filters (or any others), or dynamic exception filters used to identify exceptions which may require attention. These filters must be built using the JustEnough Filters module. </p>
        <p>The entirety of the filter will be displayed as a sequence of items (e.g. Item 1 of 100) and may be navigated using the “Item” drop-down at the top of the view, or sequentially using the navigation arrows to the right.</p>
