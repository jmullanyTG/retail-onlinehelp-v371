            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effective Forecast –</span> Will be the values passed along to the replenishment engine via the Item Manager. Should align with the system forecast (blue series) before any changes are made.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">System Forecast –</span> The system generated forecast produced by the JustEnough forecasting engine. The values past the current date will represent the values produced by the winning forecast model. Any series values preceding the current date may be viewed as the “model fit”, a combination of the simulation and backtrack.</li>

            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Backtrack –</span> The backtrack series is considered to be “optimistic” in that it will correct itself in order to be closer to the historical series for each history period.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simulation –</span> The simulation is considered to be “pessimistic” in that it will not correct itself in any way over the historical periods. </li>
