        <p>Clean up maintenance related to the archived forecast data may be run periodically in order to save space on the database server. Running usp_Forecast_Maintenance_PerformCleanupGUIDTables will delete all of the “tbl_FCTemp” tables. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is extremely important that this procedure is run </span><span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline;">just prior</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to a nightly forecasting job. It cannot be run during or after the forecasting task as it will break many things.</span></p>
