        <h3 >Inventory Level Phase-in and Phase-out</h3>
        <p>Within Item Manager, users may specify a phase-in date and phase-out date for a product or set of products. These dates operate differently from the application of a redundant/discontinued order policy in that they null out the effective forecast values outside the bounds of the phase period. Users wishing to affect ordering behavior should do so through manipulation of the order policy. </p>
