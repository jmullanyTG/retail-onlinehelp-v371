        <h3 >General Workflow Features</h3>
        <p>Within the forecast viewer, there are several action buttons which will determine what is done with the forecast.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save – </span>If any changes are made to the forecast (re-forecast, manual forecast adjustments, etc), the save button will become available. If the forecast alterations are intended to be kept, users should use the save button to enable these changes. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undo -</span> If any changes are made to the forecast (re-forecast, manual forecast adjustments, etc), the undo button will become available. If users wish to undo the changes, they may do so using this button. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change All –</span> The “change all” button will allow users to change multiple lines (either rows or columns) within the grid. They may be set to a specified value, increased or decreased, copied from another column or row, or split across sever other columns based on a percent contribution. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forecast –</span> The forecast button will give users the opportunity to re-forecast the inventory item. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock –</span> The lock button will allow users to include or exclude certain forecasting methods from being run for the inventory item. A “lock expiration” must be set in order to determine the period of time for which the lock is intended to cover. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlock –</span> If a forecast has had a method lock applied, the “unlock” button will appear, allowing users to remove the method lock.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reviewed –</span> As part of a business flow process, the reviewed button may be used to show that particular forecast for an item has been approved by the appropriate user. Clicking “review” will also populate the current date in the “reviewed” field.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes –</span> Launches the notes viewer, which will allow users to communicate any information related to the particular inventory item as it relates to the forecast. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Causals –</span> Launches the maintain item causal links window, which will allow users to include or exclude any causals which have been created in the JustEnough Causals module. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Item Manager –</span> Launches an item manager view for the inventory item in order to bring additional pertinent information to the user’s attention. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forecast All –</span> Near the navigation tool, the “forecast all” button will allow users to run a re-forecast for all items within the filter. For very large filters, this may take some time.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings –</span> Launches the “visible bucket period limits” window. This will determine the number of periods which will be displayed in both the graph and grid sections of the forecast viewer. Depending on the period (bucket) type, be it daily, weekly, or monthly, the visible bucket period limits may be adjusted in order to take a bigger picture look at the inventory item, or narrow the focus if so desired. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replace –</span> If the users have determined a need to replace the method by choosing a different method from the drop-down list, the “replace” button will appear. Selecting this will replace the effective forecast.</li>
        </ul>
