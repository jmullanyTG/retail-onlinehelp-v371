        <h3 >Grid View</h3>
        <p>The grid view gives users an opportunity to interact with the forecast series using specific values. Manual forecast values may be entered for the current period and any future periods. These changes will affect the graph.</p>
        <p>Clicking on the values in the grid will highlight the associated series in the graph. Any series represented by a line will become thicker, and bar graph series will show additional shading. </p>
        <p class="Default">The data displayed on the graph view is colored coded to match the corresponding data series in the grid view.&#160; Users can select the individual data series to be displayed on the graph by marking the “visible” checkbox for the specific data series on the grid view.</p>
