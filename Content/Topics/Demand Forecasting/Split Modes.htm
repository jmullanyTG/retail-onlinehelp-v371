        <h4 >Split Modes</h4>
        <p>Higher level forecast types have multiple selectable split methods which may be applied by type through system polices. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 8pt;">Aggregate Item Sales – Aggregated inventory sales history (this may be set by inventory history or sales history by type, selectable through a system policy).</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 8pt;">Aggregate Site Sales (Applies to Aggregate Forecasting only) – Aggregated Sales at all sites.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 8pt;">Temporal Forecast – Split using the forecast that varies by time period.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-bottom: 8pt;">Custom – Custom aggregate factors provided by end users or through a custom procedure.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;">A default split type for all forecast types will be set as a system policy, and each forecast type may be assigned a specific split type beyond the default. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;">Aggregate Item Sales and Aggregate Site Sales are cached (<span style="font-family: Consolas;font-size: 9pt;">usp_Forecast_Split_Calculate</span>) whenever possible.&#160; In Group Forecasting, because a group forecast can vary depending upon which sales types a model uses, the factors are calculated real time.&#160; For Level, Aggregate, and Profile forecasts, the system expects cached entries; if no cached entries are found, a temporal forecast will be used to fill in missing factors.</p>
