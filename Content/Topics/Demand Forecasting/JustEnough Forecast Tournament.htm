        <h1 class="Heading1">JustEnough Forecast Tournament</h1>
        <p>During a forecasting task, JustEnough’s powerful forecasting engine generates forecasts using a variety of forecasting methods and, based on the rules outlined in the Forecast Definition module, compares these methods against one another. The methods which are able to provide a series which meets all of the specified rules/requirements will be ranked by method fit with the highest method fit being displayed.</p>
        <p>It is typical for the forecasting computations to be run as part of an overnight process (commonly a weekly task) for all items, and then managed by <a href="../Exceptions/Forecast/Forecast Exceptions Overview.htm">exception</a> individually. Forecasts may be re-run for individual items from within the forecast viewer using the same tournament concept, however, certain methods may be excluded or locked for individual forecasts.</p>
