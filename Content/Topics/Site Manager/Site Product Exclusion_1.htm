        <h1 >Site Product Exclusion</h1>
        <p>Only one product exclusion may be set per site at a time. As such, users must either create an appropriate item master filter to fulfil their requirements, or set the exclusion at an applicable level of the hierarchy. </p>
        <h2 >ItemMaster Hierarchy Level </h2>
        <p>When ItemMaster hierarchy level is selected, users will be presented with a tree wizard which represents the selected hierarchy as set by the system policy. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Levels which should be excluded should be selected with a check mark. </p>
        <h2 >ItemMaster FilterMaster</h2>
        <p>When ItemMaster filter master is selected, users will choose a filter using the filter chooser, which will then be applied.</p>
