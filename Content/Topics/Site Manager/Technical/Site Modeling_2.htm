        <h2 >Sales History</h2>
        <p>Site modeling will create entries in <span style="font-family: Consolas;font-size: 9pt;">tbl_SalesHistoryByType</span> as supersession sales history. In order to process the site modeling data, <span style="font-family: Consolas;font-size: 9pt;">usp_Site_Model_ProcessModelData</span> must be run. It is recommended to add this procedure as a task within the daily job, or as frequently as sales history is updated within JustEnough. </p>
        <h2 >Site Opening Date</h2>
