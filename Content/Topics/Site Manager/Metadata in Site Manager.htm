        <h1>Metadata in Site Manager</h1>
        <p>A wealth of metadata about your sites is available in Site Manager. You can add this data as columns in Site Manager documents and use it in site filters to find sites which match specific criteria.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of how  metadata in Site Manager can help you better understand how sites are being used across JustEnough. </p>
        <h2>Exception-based filtering</h2>
        <p>You can use metadata to create exception filters that identify sites in need of additional configuration, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sites that have not yet been assigned to a <a href="../Cluster Site Manager/Filtering Sites in Site Clusters.htm">site cluster</a></li>
            <li>Sites that do not appear in any Allocation <a href="../Allocations/Filtering Sites in Location Strategies.htm">location strategies</a>.</li>
            <li>Sites that have not been added to a <a href="../Supply Chain/Filtering for Unconfigured Supply Chains.htm">supply chain.</a> </li>
        </ul>
