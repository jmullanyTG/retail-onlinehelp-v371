        <h1>Site Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>You can view and edit information about your sites from within Site Manager.</p>
        <h2>Site Manager documents</h2>
        <p>Site data is managed in tabs called Site Manager documents. The collection of sites displayed in a Site Manager document is controlled by a filter, allowing you to quickly limit the sites you are working on to only those that need your attention. You can have multiple documents open at a time, and each document can list a separate set of sites. </p>
        <h2>Site modeling</h2>
        <p>When opening a new store or DC, you can choose an existing store or DC to model forecasts after. This creates a store supersession, which tells JustEnough to use the product-level sales history from the model site to forecast demand for the new site. Orders for the new site can then be generated based on the modeled forecasts. </p>

        <h2>Global priority</h2>
        <p>Global priority sets the default order in which sites should be sourced when any site experiences a shortfall in stock. For more information about source prioritization, see <a href="../Supply Chain/Supply Chain Overview.htm">Customizable source priority</a>.</p>
