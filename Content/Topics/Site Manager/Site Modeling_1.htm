        <p>For each line, users must select a model site, which will determine the set of historical sales to be copied, as well as a factor. The factor will determine the percentage of sales to be applied in the model. A factor of “1” will copy 100% of the sales quantity; a factor of “0.5” will copy 50% of the sales quantity. </p>
