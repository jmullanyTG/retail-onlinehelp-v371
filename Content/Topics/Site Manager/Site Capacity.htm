        <h2>Site-Specific and Aggregate Capacity by Product Level</h2>
        <p>You can define site capacities at a desired level in your product hierarchy (total store, department, style, etc.) and JustEnough will show you the aggregated capacity at the higher levels. </p>
        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Product Hierarchy</b> : Defined in Views &gt; Maintenance &gt; <b>Hierarchy Filtering</b> In the view, enable all of the levels of the hierarchy you want to use, with the lowest level enabled being the level at which site capacity will be entered. </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>System Policy:</b> In the system policy <b>Module: Site Manager &gt; Site Capacity: Product Hierarchy</b>, enter the ID of the hierarchy from the Hierarchy Filtering view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once this setup is completed, you can enter site capacities for each of your locations in the Site Manager’s Site Capacity detail tab. (Remember, you can only enter values at the lowest level of the product hierarchy.) Once capacities are entered, you can view aggregate capacities by selecting higher hierarchy levels in the tab.</p>
