        <h1 >Document Functions</h1>
        <p>The flexible document format allows users to create multiple Site Manager views and manipulate them in order to create relevant comparative reports. As documents are created, they will be opened in tabs across the top of the Site Manager. These tabs contain “drag-and-drop” functionality which will allow users to re-order them, as well as un-dock them from the JustEnough user interface. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Documents may be docked back into the JustEnough shell using the reticle, or extended to a secondary monitor. Users are able to browse to other modules within the application while the document remains open. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Through use of the reticle, the documents may be rearranged into side-by-side, or vertical layouts.</p>
