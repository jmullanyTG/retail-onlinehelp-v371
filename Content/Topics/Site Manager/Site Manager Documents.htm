        <h1 class="Heading1">Site Manager Documents</h1>
        <p>Site Manager views are organized as documents. Documents are a flexible way to view reports and data within JustEnough as they allow users to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Undock the view from the UI shell, thus giving users window management options. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Take advantage of multi-screen setups.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Organize documents into vertical or horizontal tabs, allowing for side-by-side comparison of filters. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;">Use enhanced navigation with several documents, including the use of “ctrl + tab” to switch between document tabs. </li>
        </ul>
