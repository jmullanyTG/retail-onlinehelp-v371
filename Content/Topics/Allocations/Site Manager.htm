        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Receiving Schedule – </span>Controls the days on which a store or DC may receive delivered stock. Orders will not be generated for any day on which stock may not be received into the location. Typically applied to stores. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shipping Schedule –</span> Controls the days on which a store or DC may ship stock out of the location. Orders will not be recommended for shipment on any day on which stock may not be shipped from a source location. Typically applied to DCs. </li>

        <p>Schedule sets should be configured within the JustEnough Schedules Manager module. Shipping and receiving schedules may also be applied at the inventory (item-location) level within the Item Manager; inventory level schedules will override site level schedule values as they are considered an override. </p>
