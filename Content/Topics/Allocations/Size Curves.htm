        <p>Size Curves can be created and applied to product allocations in order to ensure the correct sizes and size distributions are executed. </p>
        <p>Within JustEnough, size distribution curves may be created based on historical sales or imported and maintained. Size curves are saved and may be re-applied to multiple products and by multiple users. </p>
