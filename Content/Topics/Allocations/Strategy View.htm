        <h4 >Strategy View </h4>
        <p>As there are many fields in the strategy view, it is advised to create saved layouts based on the item sets and how they are managed (planned demand, reactive demand modeling, etc.) and in these layouts, include or exclude the relevant metrics. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocations/Strategy View.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 673px;height: 245px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The strategy screen will be populated based on the filter. To create actionable allocation strategies, users must select a size curve, a location strategy, a product model, and set the demand signal. </p>
        <h5 >Product Model</h5>
        <p>Selecting the ellipses (â€¦) in the product model field will launch the product models selection wizard. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocations/Strategy View_1.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 482px;height: 405px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Here, users may choose from the available product models which have been defined in the product model screen. </p>
        <h5 >Size Curve Assignment</h5>
        <p>Within this field, users may select from the available size curves which have been created in the size curve screen using a drop down menu. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocations/Strategy View_2.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 559px;height: 332px;" />
        </p>
        <h5 >Location Strategy</h5>
        <p>Within this field, users may select from the available location strategies which have been created in the location strategy screen using a drop down menu. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocations/Strategy View_3.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 492px;height: 225px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once selected, users may choose to refine the settings by location by using the location strategy exceptions. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Allocations/Strategy View_4.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 673px;height: 255px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Here, users may select a different size curve, set of trigger dates, demand shape, and other settings by location. This allows users full control of how the allocations are managed on a location by location basis. </p>
