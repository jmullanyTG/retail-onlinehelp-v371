        <h3 >Allocation Strategy</h3>
        <p>The allocation strategy screen is the main workflow screen within the module. Users will choose a product filter to populate the screen with strategies, each line of which is comprised of a variant or a group. Additional exception filtering may be done by using the strategy exception filtering in order to prioritize work by managing exceptions. </p>
