        <h3>Allocation Strategy</h3>
        <p>The allocation strategy screen is the main workflow of the allocations module. Once a set of strategies has been returned to the screen, users will select drivers from the product model, location strategy, and size curve sections in order to determine the appropriate method for distributing stock. Several fields exist within the allocation strategy screen which will only be applicable to certain strategy types; as such, it is encouraged to use saved layouts in order to streamline the workflow. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculate Allocation – </span>When checked, upon action of the “Save” button, the allocation strategy will be recalculated based on any changes made. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rollup – </span>The rollup view button embedded within the allocation strategy screen will launch a context sensitive rollup view containing information on the highlighted strategy. This rollup view will present a more narrow focus when compared to the allocation rollup screen.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Flag – </span>Checked if the strategy is currently active.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allocate Strategy – </span>A unique identifier for the strategy line. Any active product groups will also be assigned a unique allocate strategy ID. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Code – </span>The identifying code for the level ID associated with the strategy. This code will be the item master group code of the hierarchal level defined in the allocation hierarchy. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description – </span>A description accompanying the code. This description will be the item master group description of the hierarchal level defined in the allocation hierarchy.</li>

Typically, these strategy selections will be determined by product lifecycle status. This field will drive which exceptions are triggered, how some of the settings are applied, and which process (Allocations or Replenishment) manages the item. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Item – </span>An item without sales history, or with a minimal volume of sales history data which has been deemed insufficient to drive allocation measures. The “new item” strategy selection may be used to drive initial load supply chains (e.g. circumventing regional distribution centers). The individual supply chain mapping configuration for the different strategy selection values is maintained in the Supply Chain Map Configuration maintenance view). New Items are managed by the Allocations engine.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ongoing Item – </span>An item which has multiple points of sales history data. This item may have a re-trending method applied to the sales projection. Ongoing items are managed by the Allocations engine.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: circle;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replenishment – </span>An item which no longer needs to be managed at the strategy level and may be put on an automated replenishment strategy. Replenishment items are managed by the Replenishment engine, which takes over responsibility from the Allocations engine for executing processes and providing item-related information. When this option is selected and saved, the strategy line becomes read-only. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Item Exceptions – </span>Any and all item level exceptions which have been triggered will appear in this field. Multiple exceptions may be viewed in the exception detail view. </li>
