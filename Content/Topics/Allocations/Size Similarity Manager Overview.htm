        <h1 class="Heading1">Size Similarity Manager Overview</h1>
        <p>It is not uncommon for the same real size to be present in a database under multiple names (ex. Size small could be represented as S, SM, SML, etc.). This could be due to issues with the way data imports are set up or even problems with the master data being fed into JustEnough, but whatever the cause, these additional data points can cause unintended dilution when calculating and working with size curves. The Size Similarity Manager was designed to allow users to identify sizes that should be treated together as one, specify a single name under which to unify and display them, and ultimately work with them as a single entity without the need to manually unify the relevant data points.</p>
        <p>The Size Similarity Manager can be accessed through the Views module – <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan &gt; Views &gt; Size Similarity Manager</span>:</p>
