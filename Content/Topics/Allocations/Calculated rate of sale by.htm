        <h1>Calculated rate of sale by grade</h1>

        </p>
        <p>To apply the rate of sale to the grades, users select a strategy from the scenario list. For each scenario, the scenario results will show in both their raw form and the adjusted rate of sale which accounts for data cleansing. </p>
        <p>Users may select the appropriate rate of sale from the percentile breakdown of contributing products from worst performing products to best performing. Checking the appropriate “selected” box for the grade in question will utilize the selected rate of sale.</p>
        <p>Next, users will execute the apply rate of sale tab with the appropriate allocation filter to return any items where the “rate of sale by grade” demand type is used.</p>
        <p>Finally, users can select the strategies to which to apply the rate of sale scenarios by checking the selected box and clicking on the copy rate of sale button and saving the changes. The result will be reflected in the allocation strategy screen in the calculated rate of sale column. </p>
