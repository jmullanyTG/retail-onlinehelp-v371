        <h3 >Configuration of Groups</h3>
        <p>An important concept to understand when configuring and monitoring product groups is that they are built without regard to the location dimension. As such, inferences must be made in relation to actualized sales and on hand quantities (including rate of sale, available stock on hand, total inbound, etc.). In order to make these inferences, the DC site and item master information as defined by the product eligibility are used to build internal estimates of these metrics. </p>
        <p>In order to optimize performance, product eligibility filters should be built with a narrow focus as relates to the scope of the product group. A system policy will also define the maximum number of variants which may be included within any product group. </p>
