        <h3 >Cluster Rate of Sale</h3>
        <p>With the cluster rate of sale demand type, allocation strategies are able to use clusters/grades as the basis for location eligibility, users have the ability to introduce a rate of sale for each grade. </p>
        <p>In its most simple form, users are able to set the rate of sale they believe is achievable for each one for the grades by setting the rate of sale override in the Cluster ROS tab for each allocation strategy.</p>
