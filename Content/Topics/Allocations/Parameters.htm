        <h1>Parameters</h1>
        <p>Several parameters and filters exist which may be used to narrow the focus of the allocation strategy screen in order to better facilitate a practical workflow for users. </p>
        <h2>
            <h>
                <h><span style="font-weight: bold;">Strategy </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Filter</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>

            <h>
                <h><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Any exception which occurs at the strategy level may be included in a filter for the allocation strategy screen. Many of these exceptions will be “blocking”, meaning that no action may be taken with the strategy until they are addressed. These strategy filter conditions are organized by group and are not mutually exclusive.</h>
            </h>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allocation Strategy State –</span> Status of the strategy as defined by the allocation strategy state field. </p>

                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active – </span>Default state. The strategy may be actively managed and allocations may be created using the strategy. Type 1.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hidden – </span>Strategies with no actionable stock may be set to hidden to ease navigation. Type 2. </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inactive – </span>User driven status to deactivate a strategy. Type 3.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deleted – </span>System setting for inactive strategies which may be removed from JustEnough. Type 4.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allocation Exception Status – </span>Displays if required configuration elements are missing from the strategy or if it is ready to allocate. <ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Missing Configuration –</span> Required elements are missing and the strategy may not be executed without completion. </p></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ready to Allocate –</span> The strategy is ready to allocate. </li></ul></li>

        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Allocation Strategy Exceptions </span>
        </h3>
        <p>If a strategy is considered to have missing configuration elements and is otherwise not ready to allocate, these criteria may cause blocking errors.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>An item master level filter which will return the appropriate variants to the strategy screen. Users may also launch the filter manager wizard directly from the allocation strategy screen in order to build a new filter or edit an existing filter. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display Items Below Thresholds –</span> Unselected by default, the display items below thresholds flag will determine if strategies containing items which do not meet criteria defined by an individual exception threshold defined in a threshold table are returned to the allocation strategy screen or ignored. This is meant to streamline workflows by eliminating strategies with minimal stock. </li>
