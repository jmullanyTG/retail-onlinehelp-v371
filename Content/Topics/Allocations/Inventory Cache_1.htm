        <h4 >Inventory Cache</h4>
        <p>When variants enter a product group, their inventory cache records and stock holding projection records will be marked as deleted. If the variant were to later leave the product group, the allocation strategy will be marked as “dirty” and will require a recalculation in order to rebuild the inventory cache. </p>
