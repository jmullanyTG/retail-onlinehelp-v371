        <h3 >Supply Chain Configuration</h3>
        <p>Supply chain mapping is controlled through a maintenance and configuration view (Supply Chain Map Configuration). Both “ongoing item” and “replenishment” strategy selection types share a supply chain. The default supply chain for Adaptive Allocations is also controlled within this maintenance view. Values within the supply chain map configuration view will override any default values within system policy (e.g. allocations default active supply chain).</p>
