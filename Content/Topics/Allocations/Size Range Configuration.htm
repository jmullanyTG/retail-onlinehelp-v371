        <h3 >Size Range Configuration</h3>
        <p>Size range data should be imported as part of the size range feed. Size ranges differ from size curves in that a range is simply a container for all possible sizes which may be included in a curve. Ranges may be reused for multiple location specific curves and contribution levels are stored as part of a curve, and not as part of a range. Configuration of size ranges may also be done through the size range manager maintenance view. Once a size curve is linked to a range, the range may not be altered or deleted. </p>
        <p>Upon creation of a size range, the system will auto-generate a default curve to prevent possibilities of torn data. The default auto-generated curve value may be replaced as the default curve with a user calculated curve if desired. </p>
