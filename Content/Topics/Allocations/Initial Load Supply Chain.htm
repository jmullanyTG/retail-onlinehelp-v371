        <h4 >Initial Load Supply Chain</h4>
        <p>A supply chain may be configured in order to assist with the unique sourcing requirements for initial load in of products. Initial load in of products is generally considered as an initial allocation of new items into stores in order to set up for a new floor set. Additionally initial load in can be considered as a new drop of items to be merchandised as part of a strategy to change the “look and feel” of how stores are merchandised for Back to School, Christmas, Spring or Summer, as examples.&#160; Controlled through the allocation strategy selection field, an initial load supply chain will be used when “new item” is selected.&#160; This feature supports the use case for retailers and/or brand owners who distribute new items from a different supply chain configuration than ongoing items or subsequent allocations following an initial allocation. </p>

        <p>When New Item is selected as part of an allocation strategy, the system will source inventory for stores based on the supply chain that is mapped in the Supply Chain Map Configuration view for Allocation.NewItem.SupplyChain.</p>

        <p>When Ongoing Allocation is selected as part of an allocation strategy, the system will source inventory for stores based on the supply chain that is mapped in the Supply Chain Map Configuration view for Allocation.Ongoing.SupplyChain.</p>
        <p>The system policy Allocate.DefaultActiveSupplyChainID is used only to pre-populate the supply chain map configuration view. </p>
