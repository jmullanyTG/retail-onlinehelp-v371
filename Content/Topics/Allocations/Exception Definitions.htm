        <h3 >Exception Definitions</h3>
        <p>Exceptions are divided into categories depending on the level of data which is used to calculate the exception. Exceptions can occur at the strategy level, meaning that settings are incomplete within the strategy itself, and at an inventory (variant-size/site) level for stocking concerns. These exceptions will apply to either all types, or specific types of allocation strategy selections. </p>
