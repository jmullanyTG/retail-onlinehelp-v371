                <p><span style="color: #000000;">First, because not all sizes carry equal importance at a g</span><span style="color: #000000;">iven site, the system d</span><span style="color: #000000;">etermines the relative importance of each size present in the selected Size Range for each site</span><span style="color: #000000;"> by summing the uncleansed sales by size for all items in the selected Filter and date range then dividing by </span><span style="color: #000000;">the sum of sales for all sizes.</span>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;">Next, each period in the selected date range is evaluated against the set Percent Covered threshold</span><span style="color: #000000;">. T</span><span style="color: #000000;">he </span><span style="color: #000000;">% contribution of all sizes in stock for each variant at that site are summed and compared to the Percent Covered threshold – if the sum value is equal or greater, the sales for that variant/period are included in the size curve calculation for that site; if not, they are removed.</span>

            <li style="margin-bottom: 0pt;">
                <p><span style="color: #000000;">The system evaluates each period for each variant to see if it was acceptably in-stock at the site. If no Percent Covered threshold is specified, </span><span style="color: #000000;">the system simply checks if there was stock on-hand in any size for each period .</span>

                <p><span style="color: #000000;">In-stock periods are then counted for each variant and compared to the Weeks Covered threshold – variants with counts equal to or greater than the threshold are included in the size curve calculation for that site; variants </span><span style="color: #000000;">with lower counts are</span><span style="color: #000000;"> removed. </span>
