        <h1 class="Heading1">Size Curve Substitution</h1>
        <p>When size curves are calculated, it is not uncommon for some sites to have sub-optimal curves. This could be due to poor size availability, poor overall sales, or just lack of data – like you would see with new stores that don’t yet have enough data to support generation of their own curves. To address this, functionality has been added to allow users to substitute the curve of one site for another and sync updates to subbed curves, in addition to the existing ability to make manual curve edits</p>
        <p>This functionality is accessible in the Size Curves tab:</p>
