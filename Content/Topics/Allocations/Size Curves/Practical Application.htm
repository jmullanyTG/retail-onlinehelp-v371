        <h1 >Practical Application</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">Building on the examples shown above in the Data Cleansing Thresholds descriptions, let’s look at the outcome based on the data shown then compare it to how the system would have calculated the size curve without the application of the cleansing thresholds:</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;text-align: center;">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Practical Application.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 634px;height: 465px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;color: #000000;">The example above shows total sales by variant by size after the Percent Covered Threshold is applied – note how sales for weeks without the “X” indicating inclusion of the week are not included in the totals. Additionally, the green section at the bottom shows the final sales totals after the Weeks Covered threshold is applied – note that the sales for variant 3 are also not included, because it did not have enough in-stock weeks to meet the threshold</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Allocation Size/Practical Application_1.png" style="visibility: visible;width: 635px;height: 203px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;color: #000000;">Now, let’s compare the resulting size curve with the curve generated by using sales alone, without any cleansing. Notice, in the example above, that both curves are weighted heavier in the smaller end of the size spectrum, but there are definite differences between the two outcomes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;color: #000000;">The uncleansed data weighted the fringe sizes (S and XXL) heavier than their cleansed counterparts</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;color: #000000;">The uncleansed data shows size S to be the biggest sales contributor, whereas the cleansed data shows size L as the clear winner</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;color: #000000;">Whether the cleansed data in this particular example represents the “truth” or not really depends on the nuances of the business. The purpose of data cleansing is to provide a data set that is representative of consistent normal selling trends without anomalies to skew the result. </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="color: #000000;">In this case, one might infer that customers may have gravitated toward sizes that are not their ideal because </span><span style="color: #000000;">of stock outages. If this is true, it means that the data cleansing will prevent you from over-ordering in fringe sizes and repeating the same stock outage problems in sizes that are more important under normal circumstances. Identifying the proper threshold settings for optimal size curve generation in your organization may require some trial and error, but when done properly, it can help avoid lost sales due to insufficient stock by size and minimize the need for post-allocation transfer activities</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
