        <h1 >Recalculating Size Curves When Overrides are Present</h1>
        <p>Any overrides present, including size curve substitutions, Sync Overrides, and changes to Is Eligible? checkboxes, at the time a size curve is recalculated will be retained until the overrides are cleared via the method described above, however, new size curves will still be calculated for overridden sites. This is done to prevent the user from having to reinstate changes made to select sites when they want to use new data for sites that have not been overridden.</p>
