        <h1 class="Heading1">Enhanced Size Curve Calculation</h1>
        <p>Size Curves can more closely estimate future size needs for a group of products by utilizing inventory on-hand data. Users can set thresholds to determine whether a given variant was acceptably “in-stock” based on the relative importance of each size to a total range and whether or not that variant had enough in-stock periods to be included in the size curve calculation. These thresholds are used by the system to smooth anomalies in the selling data and get to the core sizing needs for groups of products at each site.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="color: #000000;">This functionality is built into the Size Curves tab and, if the <a href="Curve Calculation Requirements.htm">prerequisites</a> are met, applied   when creating a new size curve or changing an existing one.</p>
