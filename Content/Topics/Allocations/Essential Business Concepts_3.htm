        <p>Within the product modeling screen, users will create product models for use in the allocation strategy screen. These product models are built using historical data from groups or levels of similar products over a specified time period.&#160; </p>
        <p>There are two methods for model rule selection: fixed and set period rolling. A fixed period will supply a start and end date which creates the fixed period. The set and rolling period rule will specify a set distance in the past (365 days in the past from today) plus a defined rolling period (+90 days). This would create the period as the next 90 days from exactly one year ago. </p>
