        <h3 >Size Curve Calculation</h3>
        <p>When checked, the size curve calculation button will use the sales history (based on the supplied size curve calculation parameters) to calculate the contribution quantities to build a size distribution curve for the variant. The size curve calculation will run after the equal distribution population (part of the size curve “save” process), and update the values. All values from the calculation will be normalized to 100% across the breadth of the range. </p>
        <p>For sizes which have been marked as ineligible, if sales history exists for the item, the calculation will not populate a contribution value. </p>
