        <h4 >Causals</h4>
        <p>Users are able to add manual (multiplicative) causals to allocations sales plans. These causals may relate to planned promotions for items managed within Allocations, but for which the lift is not incorporated into the existing sales curve. These links may be applied through item master links within the Causals module. This feature is controlled through the system policy “Allocate.ApplyManualCausals”.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 8pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Please note:</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> T</span><span style="font-style: italic;">he application of the manual causal in allocations will result in an increase in the total sales profile for the item/site, equal to the percentage increase assigned by the causal to the base profile forecast for the periods defined by the causal. For example, if an item/site has a forecast for 10 units each week for three weeks, the addition of a 50% uplift manual causal in one of those weeks would result in a total sales profile of 35 units instead of 30 units.</span>
        </p>
        <h5 >Application Mode for Manual Causals</h5>
        <p>Users may select how to apply manual causals (i.e. to track promotions) within Allocations: “lift” or “reshape”. A causal applied with an application mode of “lift” will affect the overall volume of sales during the product lifecycle, whereas a causal applied in “reshape” mode will hold the overall volume and adjust the individual periods. The application mode is controlled by the system policy “Allocate.CausalShiftType” (defaults to “reshape”). </p>
