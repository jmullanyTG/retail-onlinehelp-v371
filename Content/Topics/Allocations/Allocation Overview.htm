        <p>The JustEnough Allocations module presents users with a clear and defined workflow in order to produce execution orders for the transfer of merchandise throughout their supply chain at a level above Item Master (typically defined as “variant”).</p>
        <p>The Allocations module also offers the potential to bridge the gaps in functionality between the planning modules (Merchandise Financial Planning, Assortment Planning), and the execution modules (Demand Forecasting, Inventory Planning). </p>
