        <h3 >Behavior of Product Groups within Allocations Rollup</h3>
        <p>Users may put a lot of different things in a product group which might not be at the same aggregation level, so they may not aggregate correctly. As a result, aggregation will be done to the lowest <span style="text-decoration: underline;">common</span> level. All common levels will display the product group name instead of an aggregatable level. Within the product groups, size behaves like an attribute instead of a product dimension level.</p>
        <p>If an item filter contains some items which are in a product group and some which are not in in product groups, one row will be displayed for the product group and the rest of the items will have the expected hierarchal value names for that item. </p>
