        <p>In Site Manager, site data is managed in tabs called site documents. The collection of sites displayed in a site document is controlled by a filter, allowing you to quickly limit the sites you are working on to only those that need your attention. You can have multiple site documents open at a time, and each document can list a separate set of sites. </p>
