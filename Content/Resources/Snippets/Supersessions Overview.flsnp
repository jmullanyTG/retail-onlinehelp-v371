        <p>When you launch a new product, supersessions become vital to having the right amount of product in your stores or warehouses. Supersessions let you create accurate demand forecasts for items with little or no history. All you have to do is link the new product to a similar existing product or products, and JustEnough does the rest. It creates demand forecasts for the new item based on the existing item's sales history--even capturing seasonality . You can also use supersessions to set up replacement strategies that replenish the "existing" item's stock with the new item. </p>
