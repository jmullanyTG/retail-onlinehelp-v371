        <h1>Retail Lexicon</h1>
        <p>A Retail Lexicon is a definitive dictionary of business terms and relationships used across a retail enterprise. The definitions must be designed to engender a common understanding of what is meant by the term for all employees and key business partners regardless of business function.</p>
        <p>Mi9 Retail’s suite of applications covers a broad range of functionality, and for this reason, a bridge between the retailer’s terms and ours must be made so that a consistent language is used by all users.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to list and define the terms often used by retailers, and where applicable, provide Mi9 Retail’s definition and alternative term. The goal is to avoid confusions and statements such as “Sorry, I thought you meant something else.”</p>
        <p>Unclear information can cripple a sales force, obscuring opportunities and slowing response times to shifts in market conditions. It is Mi9 Retail’s sincere ambition to ensure that a common language is used when designing our applications and reports. In this way, we can connect to our retailers and their staff by providing business information they can trust, helping to eliminate any misunderstandings that can cause lost time, lost opportunities and lost revenue.</p>
        <p>Terms</p>
        <p>This document intends to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Define shared, common, and approved retail terms</li>
            <li>Capture trusted, enterprise-wide definitions of retail terms</li>
            <li>Associate retail terms to a business structure</li>
